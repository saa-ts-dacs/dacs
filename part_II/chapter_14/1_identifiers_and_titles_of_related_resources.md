# 14.1 Identifiers and Titles of Related Resources

Commentary: While authority records are created to document the context in which archival materials were created, it is also desirable to associate them with descriptions of the materials themselves and with other, external data that provides additional information about the entity described in the record. These connections may be electronic links within an archival information system between the authority record and associated descriptions or links to external files such as online biographical databases. They may also be recorded as citations in a print-based authority file.

**14.1.1** Provide the unique identifiers/reference codes or titles for the related resources necessary to establish a connection between the entity and the related resource.
