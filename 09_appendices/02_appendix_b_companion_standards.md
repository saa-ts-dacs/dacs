# Appendix B Companion Standards

As indicated in the Overview, DACS includes basic rules for the types of holdings found in many archives, but they do not include all the rules needed to describe every possible type of document. Where further guidance is required, the following standards provide more detailed rules for describing published materials and particular types of nontextual materials. For the most comprehensive and up-to-date listing of standards, see the Society of American Archivists’ Standards Portal: http://www2.archivists.org/standards.
