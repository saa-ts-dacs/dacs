**Slide 1: Introduction**

Hello, my name is Amelia Holmes and I am an archives student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Welcome to the fourth video in the Society of American Archivists instructional video series on *Describing Archives: A Content Standard*.

In this video we will be going over crosswalking DACS. Once this video is over, you should understand what crosswalking is and why archivists would want to crosswalk between DACS and other standards. This video is free and available to anyone who wants to learn more about DACS, but if you sign up to take the DACS workshop for credit, you will be responsible for understanding this content, and there will be a quiz to test your understanding.

**Slide 2: Learning Objectives**

In this video we will be talking about crosswalking between DACS and a variety of other standards. After watching this video, you should be able to crosswalk between DACS and a variety of other standards and understand why interoperating between various standards is important in the work of archivists engaged with archival description.

**Slide 3: What is Crosswalking?**

Crosswalking is “a mapping of the elements, semantics, and syntax from one metadata schema to those of another” (NISO 2004). Crosswalks are literally charts or maps that show how one set of elements from a metadata scheme correspond to another set of elements in a different metadata scheme. Crosswalks are important because they allow archives to make their collections more discoverable by sharing archival description with systems outside of their own, such as in a library catalog or ArchiveGrid. As many archivists know, systems for storing archival descriptions will change. Whether your data is stored on paper finding aids or in a sophisticated database, chances are you’ll have to move that data into a new system. Crosswalks help you do that. Many systems, such as ArchivesSpace, are designed to support crosswalking, which is why they are able to serialize archival description in ways that are compliant with various standards such as EAD, EAC-CPF, and MARC. Archivists who write their archival description in compliance with DACS can more efficiently implement automated measures to exchange their archival description with other systems.

**Slide 4: DACS and ISAD(G)**

ISAD(G) stands for International Standard for Archival Description (General), and is a content standard, of which DACS is the US-based local implementation. Crosswalking between ISAD(G) and DACS allows for greater sharing of consistent descriptive metadata worldwide. Archivists might crosswalk between ISAD(G) and DACS, particularly when contributing description to an international open data initiative. As another example, Access to Memory (or AtoM) is an archival description web application that provides an ISAD(G) CSV template for importing description, but it does not provide a DACS-based CSV template. In this instance, DACS-compliant description would need to be crosswalked to ISAD(G) before importing.

**Slide 5: EAD, MARC, and DACS**

Encoded Archival Description and MAchine-Readable Cataloging are data structure standards - they define the units of information, or elements, and DACS, as a content standard, defines how those units are populated. Putting EAD-encoded finding aids online allows for greater access to collection materials. Crosswalking between DACS and EAD is crucial for this work. Crosswalking DACS to MARC allows archivists who are based in libraries or other institutions that use MARC to create catalog records for archival collections, making them more easily discoverable to patrons because they are encoded in the same format as all the other materials held by the institution.

**Slide 6: RDA and DACS**

*Resource Description and Access* uses the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) as a data abstract model. Although there are problems with applying the FRBR model to archival materials, RDA does provide instructions for the description of archival collections. Crosswalking between RDA and DACS allows archivists greater opportunities for recording the characteristics and attributes of archival materials and creators. It could also aid archivists in their efforts to describe bibliographic materials that may end up in an archival collection, like grey literature or certain types of ephemera like published programs. Conversely, DACS provides greater guidance to librarians who normally work with bibliographic materials in the description of archival materials.

**Slide 7: ISAAR (CPF), EAC-CPF, and DACS**

The International Standard Archival Authority Record (Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families) and Encoded Archival Context (Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families) aim to formalize the names and corresponding information for creators of archival materials.

**Slide 8: Conclusion**

Crosswalking makes interoperability among metadata schemas possible, facilitating greater access to archival materials. Thanks for listening, and be sure to check out the rest of the videos in the Society of American Archivists series on DACS to become an archival description pro!
