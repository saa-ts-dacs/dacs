**Slide 1: Introduction**

Hello, my name is Sarah Bost and I am the Student Success Archivist at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock Center for Arkansas History and Culture. Welcome to the second video in the Society of American Archivists instructional video series on *Describing Archives: A Content Standard.* This video is free and available to anyone who wants to learn more about DACS, but if you sign up to take the DACS workshop for credit, you will be responsible for understanding this content, and there will be a quiz to test your understanding.

**Slide 2: Learning Objectives**

In this video we will be reviewing the eight principles that form the basis for the rules found in DACS. Once this video is over, you should understand the principles that guide other rules for archival description and how to apply these principles in a variety of situations.

**Slide 3: Principle 1**

Principle one is, “Records in archives possess unique characteristics.”

Several factors make archival description different from other cultural heritage descriptive practices like bibliographic cataloging and cataloging museum objects.

The first is the rare or unique nature of archival materials. A book, like Salman Rushdie’s *Midnight’s Children*, often exists in many identical copies. Records, like the Salman Rushdie papers at Emory University, are unique. While many libraries have copies of *Midnight’s Children*, no other repository holds an identical collection of Salman Rushdie’s papers. Therefore, the description of Rushdie’s papers will also be unique.

There are as many different kinds of archival collections -- in many formats and expressed differently -- as there are creators of records. Despite their uniqueness, all archival collections may be described using DACS.

**Slide 4: Principle 2 (1 of 4)**

The second factor that makes archival description distinct has to do with the nature of records. We collect records as traces of human creative activities, to give us insight into the individuals, organizations, ideas, places, and activities that happened in the past. This means that a record rarely speaks for itself. Our work as archivists is to also describe the contexts and people that brought this record into being, and the series of decisions that brought the record into an archives.

Finally, archives are often more meaningful in aggregate than as individual documents. The examination of aggregations of records can answer questions that access to de-contextualized records may obscure -- what else was happening at this time? Is a particular record typical or extraordinary in its type? How did parts of an organization or a family work together?

This principle can be very helpful to keep in mind when working on projects that bring together archival resources with non-archival cultural heritage information, like books, journals and objects. While these resources have many similarities, it’s important to understand (and to be able to articulate) how archives are different, and what is required in their description.

This second principle, known as *respect des fonds,* is the basis of archival arrangement and description. Not to be confused with The Fonz, *respect des fonds* is a principle that means that archival records should be grouped according to the administration, organization, individual, or entity by which they were created.

**Slide 5: Principle 2 (2 of 4)**

The principle of *respect des fonds* also proposes that original order, if such exists, should be maintained. To practice the principle of *respect des fonds*, archivists must recognize that archival collections have complex relationships to each other and to their creators and, by means of archival description, document the multi-faceted provenance of the records in their care.

**Slide 6: Principle 2 (3 of 4)**

For example, the Center for Arkansas History and Culture holds the papers of Winthrop Rockefeller and his son Winthrop Paul Rockefeller. Despite the familial relationship, these records are arranged and described as two separate collections to reflect their provenance.

**Slide 7: Principle 2 (4 of 4)**

The principle of *respect des fonds* is also demonstrated by the Center’s Frank White papers. While the files from White’s term as governor of Arkansas were maintained by various staffers, they have been kept together as a single unit because together they originated from and represent the functions of the Governor’s Office.

**Slide 8: Principle 3 (1 of 3)**

The third principle is, “Arrangement involves the identification of groupings within the material.” Arrangement is the intellectual and/or physical process of organizing documents by identifying logical groupings within the whole as they were established by the creator or constructing a new organization when the original order has been lost or never existed. The nature of archival collections is often such that inherent, hierarchical groupings among materials emerge as they are intellectually arranged. Sub-groupings of material inherit characteristics from groupings higher in the hierarchy. For example, a grouping of personal correspondence can contain sub-groupings based on individual correspondents.

**Slide 9: Principle 3 (2 of 3)**

When the Edgerton Women’s Health Center records arrived at Augustana College, they had no discernible original order above the folder level. The processor arranged the records into four groupings, or series: administrative records, financial records, general records, and community education and outreach. The processor arranged the first two series quote “because they were easy to define.” In other words, they were inherent groupings.

**Slide 10: Principle 3 (3 of 3)**

The John Robert Bishop papers, another collection at Augustana, required very little arrangement. The groupings within the papers were, for the most part, evident and merely required titles. The processor created the small and final series, “Other papers,” to indicate the items that did not fit neatly into one of the preceding groupings.

**Slide 11: Principle 4**

Principle four states that, “Description reflects arrangement.” Archival description may consist of a multilevel structure beginning with a description of the whole and proceeding through more detailed descriptions of the parts, or it may consist only of a description of the whole. Some parts may be described at a greater level of detail than others. Let’s take a look at an example. In addition to a description of the whole found in the collection-level scope and contents note, the Southern Historical Collection has chosen to provide detailed descriptions of each folder in the Hilliard Family papers due to anticipated researcher interest.

**Slide 12: Principle 5**

Principle five is, “The rules of description apply to all archival materials, regardless of form or medium.” The guidelines found in DACS are applicable to photographs and correspondence, moving images and audio, whether analog or digital. They can be used to describe hats, data tapes, yearbooks, and paintings; in short, anything that might be found in an archives.

**Slide 13: Principle 6**

Principle six reminds us that, “The principles of archival description apply equally to records created by corporate bodies, individuals, or families.” No matter the source of the records, the principles of archival description can be applied. This means they can be equally applied to the University of California, Santa Barbara Office of Public Affairs records, Bessye J. Bearden papers, and Cameron family papers.

**Slide 14: Principle 7**

Principle seven is, “Archival descriptions may be presented at varying levels of detail to produce a variety of outputs.” This principle is divided into three parts. We’ll take a look at each part and some corresponding examples.

**Slide 15: Principle 7.1**

Principle 7.1 is, “Levels of description correspond to levels of arrangement.” The levels of arrangement determine the levels of description. Description changes as a result of changes in arrangement, such as accruals. Some repositories make available to researchers brief descriptions of unprocessed collections. This is the case with the Alice G. Daniel papers at Duke University. As of 2016, the preliminary guide available online states that the accession is unprocessed and “materials may not have been ordered and described beyond their original condition.” Patrons are asked to contact Research Services before visiting the library to use the collection. Future arrangement activities will lead to additional description.

**Slide 16; Principle 7.2**

Principle 7.2 says, “Relationships between levels of description must be clearly indicated.” A descriptive system must be able to represent the relationships among the various parts of the descriptive hierarchy so that a user can navigate to higher and lower levels of description. If a body of records is arranged into series and subseries, it must be clear to which series a subseries belongs. The Floyd B. McKissick papers, a large body of records benefits from a hierarchical arrangement with numerous levels. The collection’s description reflects this hierarchy by indicating the relationship of a subseries to its parent series and sibling subseries.

**Slide 17: Principle 7.3**

Principle 7.3 is, “Information provided at each level of description must be appropriate to that level.” Information common to component parts should be provided at the highest applicable level while detailed information should be reserved for the lowest applicable level. Returning to the description for the Floyd B. McKissick papers, we can see that information at lower levels is more detailed while information at higher levels is more general. The description for subseries 3.1, CORE, identifies the content found throughout the subseries while the description for its component, subseries 3.1.1, Correspondence, notes prominent subjects and highlights specific authors.

**Slide 18: Principle 8**

The last principle, principle 8, is, “The creators of archival materials, as well as the materials themselves, must be described.” The activities of the creator that produced the materials should also be described. The description for the League of Women Voters of the United States records held by the Library of Congress includes information on the history of the League in prose, a timeline, and standardized access points in the form of Library of Congress authorities,

**Slide 16: Conclusion**

Taken together, these overarching principles prioritize the creator, or provenance, of the records. While archivists are instructed to arrange and describe archival materials in logical groupings, we are to take our lead from the creators’ understanding of the relationship between materials. Arrangement and description are inextricably linked, with decisions about one reflecting the other.
