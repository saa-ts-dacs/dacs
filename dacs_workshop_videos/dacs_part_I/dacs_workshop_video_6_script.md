**Introduction**

**Slide 1: Introduction**

Hello, my name is Chris Marino and I am the Reference and Outreach Archivist at UC Berkeley’s Environmental Design Archives. Welcome to the sixth video in the Society of American Archivists instructional video series on Describing Archives: A Content Standard.

**Slide 2: Learning Objectives**

In this video we will be going over how DACS came to be, continues to adapt, and how it relates to other descriptive standards. Once this video is over, you should understand how DACS is an output neutral standard that is based on national and international standards that came before, that it enables archival collections to be more accessible and places value on the intellectual component of processing, and that it is an ever changing standard that was and continues to be created by and for Archivists. This video is free and available to anyone who wants to learn more about DACS, but if you sign up to take the DACS workshop for credit, you will be responsible for understanding this content, and there will be a quiz to test your understanding.

**Slide 3: Paradigm Shift and Technology Advances**

**How DACS came to be and relates to other descriptive standards**

DACS was very much a product of its time, a direct result of a paradigm shift that occurred in the 1980s coupled with technological advancements that took place throughout the 1990s.

**Slide 4: Paradigm Shift 1980s**

In the late 1980s the Society of American Archivists’ Working Group on Standards for Archival Description (WGSAD) redefined Archival Description. This working group's definition marked a paradigm shift in the way description in the archival world was conceptualized. The focus of description was taken away from the *products* of standardized descriptions (like MARC records) and placed on the *intellectual process* underlying description.

**Slide 5: \[Internet, XML, EAD\]**

Prior to descriptive standards like DACS, the widely accepted standard for archival description was APPM or Archives, Personal Papers, and Manuscripts, a standard that provided guidelines for producing basic catalog records (i.e. MARC records) in online systems.

As time progressed, certain technological advancements such as the wide-use of the Internet in the early 1990s, the creation of XML or Extensible Markup Language in the mid to late 1990s, the launching of EAD or Encoded Archival Description in 1996, and the late 1980s paradigm shift made Archivist think critically about the limitations of APPM. It became apparent that any revision to this standard should incorporate rules for finding aids not just catalog records and in addition jibe well with the recently published international archival descriptive standards ISAD(G) and ISAAR (CPF). In the end, Archivists decided that revising APPM was not sufficient and that a new descriptive standard was needed.

**Slide 6: \[Justin Bieber, ISAD(G)\]**

1994 was a pivotal year in DACS’ history—the same year the TV show Friends came out and the year Justin Bieber was born, the International Council on Archives published its first standard called the **International Standard on Archival Description – General (ISAD G)**.

**Slide 7: ISAD(G) 26 Elements**

**ISADG** provides guidelines for creating descriptions of archival materials based on accepted theoretical principles like respect des fonds, that is organizing collections according to the entity by which they were created or received; and other principles that are rooted in the concept of multilevel description, essentially that archival description proceeds from the general to the specific.

This description standard defines 26 elements in seven areas of a descriptive record (Identity Statement, Context, Content and Structure, Condition of Access and Use, Allied Materials, Note, and Description Control), and provides general content guidelines.

**Slide 8: 1996 ISAAR (CPF) 27 Elements**

Fast-forward two years to 1996, and ICA releases the International Standard Archival Authority Record for Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families. ISAARCPF is a companion standard to **ISADG**, concerning authority records associated with archival materials. The model defines 27 elements in four areas of an authority record (Identity, Description, Relationships, and Control), and includes general content guidelines.

**Slide 9: CUSTARD**

In response to ICA’s standards, Archivists from the United States and Canada formed a joint task force with the help of a NEH grant augmented by the Delmas Foundation. CUSTARD or the Canadian-U.S. Task Force on Archival Description had three primary goals:

1. They wanted to produce a content standard that would replace APPM
2. one that would function in accordance with ISAD(G) and ISAAR(CPF)
3. and a content standard that could be applicable to all types and levels of description and archival materials

Starting in 2001, eight Canadians and seven US Archivists met four times over two years to draft a set of standards. By 2003, CUSTARD came to the conclusion that a joint content standard was not possible within the time frame. Canada stuck with their previous standard Rules for Archival Description or RAD and revamped them. By 2004, the United States Archivists had distilled the CUSTARD draft into Describing Archives: A Content Standard.

**Slide 10: TS-DACS and the 2013 Revision**

The Technical Subcommittee on Describing Archives: A Content Standard or TS-DACS is responsible for overseeing the timely and ongoing intellectual and technical maintenance and development of DACS.

When DACS undergoes a revision, Archivists on the Technical Subcommittee look at how DACS can be brought in closer alignment with recently updated companion standards as well as consult the Archival community regarding how DACS could better serve its users.

For the most recent revision in 2013 there were **four major outcomes**:

1. Part III of DACS “Forms of Names” was removed to bring it in accordance with (RDA) a companion standard.
2. Part II of DACS was reworked to contain rules for the creation of archival authority records so that it more closely aligns with ISAAR(CPF).
3. DACS was revised in response to feedback from the archival community to permit local naming conventions to describe new types of collections containing digital/electronic records.
4. As a result of soliciting the community, TS-DACS created a companion website filled with more extensive examples.

**Slide 11: Things to Remember**

In conclusion, things to remember: DACS is an output neutral standard that is based on national and international standards that came before; it enables archival collections to be more accessible and places value on the intellectual component of processing a direct result of the paradigm shift in the late 1980s articulated by WGSAD; and that it is an ever changing standard that was and continues to be created by and for Archivists.
