**Slide 1: Introduction**

Hello, my name is Sue Luftschein and I am the Archival and Metadata Librarian at the University of Southern California Libraries. Welcome to the fifth video in the Society of American Archivists instructional video series on Describing Archives: A Content Standard.

In this video, we will discuss the concepts of single-level vs. multi-level description. This video is free and available to anyone who wants to learn more about DACS, but if you sign up to take the DACS workshop for credit, you will be responsible for understanding this content, and there will be a quiz to test your understanding.

**Slide 2: Learning Objectives**

By the end of this video, you will understand the differences between the two levels of description. You will also understand the concepts of required, optimum, and added value elements and what it means for a description to be DACS-compliant. The video will be interspersed with examples of each type of description to give you an idea of how to apply these concepts to your own description.

**Slide 3: Single-level and Multi-level Description**

Archival material can be described at many different levels. Archival description can consist of only one level of description (that is single level), or it may include many different levels of description (that is multi-level).

**Slide 4: Single-level Description**

What is single level description? According to DACS, “Single-level descriptions can describe archival materials at *any* level, from large accumulations commonly referred to by archivists as collections, record groups, fonds, or record series, to single items and any level in between. They can, however, only describe materials at one level.”

**Slide 5: Multi-level Description**

What is multi-level description? According to DACS, “Multi-level description can describe archival materials beginning at any level (for example collection level or series level) and must include at least one sublevel. Typical multilevel descriptions begin with large accumulations commonly referred to by archivists as collections, record groups, fonds, or record series.” Multi-level descriptions build down from these to something more granular.

ISAD(G), the international standard for archival description upon which DACS was built, envisions a descriptive framework that recognizes four levels: fonds, series, file, and item, but DACS does not prescribe that an archivist follow this descriptive arrangement. DACS elements can be used to describe materials arranged according to this or any other scheme of articulating levels of arrangement. The most common, for archivists, is collection--series--folder--item.

**Slide 6: Single-level and Multi-level Description**

In other words, single level description is flat, multi-level description is hierarchical. DACS does not attempt to define the proper level of description for any set of archival materials. Archivists should follow the prescriptions of their institutions and apply their own judgement in making such determinations.

**Slide 7: Single-level Description Example**

Examples of single level description include collection level bibliographic records, preliminary accession records, collection level Wikipedia entries, or even museum object records.

**Slide 8: Single-level Description Example: Wikipedia**

Here’s one example

**Slide 9: Single-level Description Example: Finding Aid**

and another

**Slide 10: Multilevel Description Examples**

Examples of multi-level description include preliminary collection inventories, multiple linked MARC records, or full collection inventories, such as...

**Slide 11: Multilevel Example: Smith College Archives **

This example

**Slide 12: Required, Optimum, and Added-value Elements**

For both single- and multilevel archival description, DACS prescribes required, optimum, and added-value elements. Required elements together make up the minimum amount of information necessary for description to be DACS-compliant. Optimum elements are recommended when appropriate. Added-value elements may be of greater or lesser use, or sometimes inapplicable, depending on the particular descriptive work being done.

Decisions about whether to use DACS elements that go beyond the required set when describing a set of archival materials should be made based on a careful consideration of what resources are available to do archival description and what individuals who are interested in accessing the materials may desire from that archival description. In Video 7, we will dive into each of the required, optimum, and added-value DACS Part I elements.

**Slide 13:** **Conclusion**

So in conclusion, archival material can be described at many different levels. DACS prescribes required, optimum, and added-value elements for both single and multi-level description. Archival description, either single- or multilevel, must contain at least the required elements to be considered DACS-compliant.
