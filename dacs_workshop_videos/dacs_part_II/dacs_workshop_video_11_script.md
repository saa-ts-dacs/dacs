**Slide 1: Introduction**

Hi, my name is Tal Hurwitz. I’m a librarian and archival project manager. Welcome to the eleventh video in the Society of American Archivists instructional video series on Describing Archives: A Content Standard.

In this video, we’ll be going over Part II of DACS: Archival Authority Records. Once this video is over, you should understand how and when to include authority records in your own archival practice! This video is free and available to anyone who wants to learn more about DACS. If you sign up to take the DACS workshop for credit, you’ll be responsible for understanding this content, and there will be a quiz to test your understanding.

If you’re following along at home, you can always go back to any point in this video later.

**Slide 2: Authority Records**

DACS is a content standard developed by the Society of American Archivists and is particularly useful for its flexibility, scalability, and interoperability. It can be used to describe lots different media, both very big and very small collections, and it’s specially designed to operate in collaboration with content-specific standards, like MARC or EAD.

We use authority records to show the context in which archival materials were created. This information is really important to maintaining the integrity of the collections themselves. Authority records focus on information regarding the creation, assembly, and use of the materials being described.

Traditionally, authority records are included directly in the archival content description. These are “embedded” records. DACS accommodates this, and it also provides an alternative. This is a separated system of authority records, which are then linked to archival descriptions rather than embedded into them. This complies with certain international standards, and also carries some significant advantages. Here are a few examples:

-   You don’t need to duplicate administrative or biographical history in every single description field. That’s pretty good by itself!

-   Using a linked authority file instead of including the information in the description lets you have multiple collections, for example, all linked back to a single authority file. This can be extremely efficient.

-   You can also maintain a thesaurus of variant terms for particular entities, which you can’t easily do inside of a descriptive record.

-   Linked authority records which use controlled vocabularies - standardized by the Library of Congress Authorities, for example - can also be shared between multiple institutions. Interoperability is a key principle of the DACS system, and this shows how it can really help with collaborative information sharing.

**Slide 3: Required and Added Value Elements**

Some authority elements are required - this is the minimum amount of information you’ll have to enter to work with a DACS authority record. Required elements are really the basic pieces of information you should have to most efficiently describe and access a record.

The rest are described as “Added value elements.” They may be of greater or lesser use, or sometimes even inapplicable, depending on the particular work you’re doing. Sometimes they’re highly valuable and provide the researcher with information very important to a particular project, and sometimes they’re not necessary. The intended use of the records generally dictates which added value elements you’ll choose to include.

We’ll be going over the four elements required for creating DACS compliant archival authority records in this video. For more in-depth guidance see DACS, Part II.

**Slide 4: Categories of Authority Records**

Similar to the elements used to describe archival materials discussed in Video 7, there are a number of elements used when creating archival authority records. We’ll be discussing the four that are considered required.

The second part of DACS describes archival authority records. The four DACS required archival elements are found in chapters 10, 11, and 13. For more information on Chapter 12, “Related Corporate Bodies, Persons and Families,” and chapter 14, Related Archival Materials and other Materials, please refer to DACS.

**Slide 5: Authorized Form of Name (10.1)**

This is what you’ll use in archival authority records as a standardized form of a particular name. Variant names are certainly allowed and encouraged in secondary fields, but a single name should be designated as of primary importance. The authorized form of the name should be put together using standardized vocabulary and remain strictly consistent.

DACS recommends using the Library of Congress Authorities standards in particular, but you can use rules for creating names from manuals like AACR2, ISAAR(CPF), or RDA, or you can use whatever rules you may have in place for creating standardized names.

**Slide 6: Type of Entity (10.2)**

You can indicate here whether the entity in the authority record is a corporate body, person, or family. You can use plain text or machine codes; whichever your system uses for entry.

**Slide 7: Dates of Existence (11.1)**

Dates of Existence refer to the entity being described. For example, for a person, you’d record a date of birth and/or date of death. If you don’t know the exact date, you can indicate that you’re recording an approximation. Likewise, for a corporate body, record the dates that it was established and/or dissolved. Corporate bodies consisting of meetings or conferences follow similar rules - record the year or years of the event. For families, you can record significant dates associated with the family history, like the date it was established, or dates through which the family was active. In some circumstances, precise information might not be accessible. In this case, you can signify these periods by century.

Let me give a few particulars, because there are a lot of straightforward, but very specific guidelines for how to record dates using DACS. For this field, the standard goes something like this:

-   You’d record the exact date in year-then-month-then-day format. A probable date is indicated by adding a question mark after the year.

-   If you’re not sure whether it’s one of two years, write down year one, then a big word OR, and the second year.

-   If you have to approximate the year, you’d record the date using the specific word “approximately,’ then the year.

There are some more guidelines for ambiguous dates involving people, corporations, and families. Please refer to DACS for clear examples of how to use these.

**Slide 8: Authority Record Identifier (13.2)**

This is a unique identifier for the authority record itself, and it’s how you find it again once you’ve created it. This number can either be created internally at your institution, based on a system of like the Library of Congress Authorities, or sometimes assigned by an external organization like NARA, depending on your situation.

**Slide 9: Authority Record Sample**

So now we’ve covered the required elements that DACS uses for ensuring good, compliant archival authority records. I hope you found this video useful, and remember, you can always refer back to this resource.
