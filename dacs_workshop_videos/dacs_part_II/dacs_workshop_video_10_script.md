**Slide 1: Introduction**

Hello, my name is Anneliese Warhank and I am an archivist at the Montana Historical Society. Welcome to the tenth video in the Society of American Archivists instructional video series on Describing Archives: A Content Standard. This video is free and available to anyone who wants to learn more about DACS, but if you sign up to take the DACS workshop for credit, you will be responsible for understanding this content, and there will be a quiz to test your understanding.

This video is broken into two parts. We will first cover some important rules and concepts found in multiple elements before taking a closer look at what description looks like in elements found in sections 10, 11, and 12 of DACS.

**Slide 2: \[Portland State University\]**

Since Archival Authority Records offer a way to control the creation and use of access points in archival description that may be used to link collections held in more than one repository and to descriptions of other resources such as published books and artifacts,…

**Slide 3: \[VIRGO\]**

…providing archival description in a standardized manner increases the record’s ability to be shared.

**Slide 4: \[National Archives Catalog\]**

Unlike the description of archival collections and their functions you should expect to see in a finding aid, archival authority records provide the contextual information solely for the record creators. This is done through the creation of standardized access points in descriptions which allow for consistency and uniqueness.

**Slide 5: Consistency is Key!**

Consistency requires that the name of a creator be identical each time it is used as an access point in a descriptive system.

**Slide 6: Uniqueness Avoids Confusion!**

Uniqueness requires that each person, family, or corporate body have a heading that applies to it alone, allowing us to distinguish Thomas Jefferson, the former President, from all the other Thomas Jeffersons out there. An example of uniqueness is using birth and death dates to differentiate among people with the same name.

**Slide 7: Rely on Data Content and Value Standards for Names…**

Both these aspects can be achieved by using names found in the Library of Congress Authorities or use rules for formulating standardized names such as those found in ISAAR(CPF), or RDA.

**Slide 8: … and Dates**

Consistency and uniqueness are also required for any dates included in the authority record.

Dates should be formatted by following the guidelines set forth by ISO 8601: Record exact dates in \[year\] \[month\] \[day\] format. Indicate a probable date by adding a question mark following the year. If the year is uncertain but known to be either one of two years, record the dates as the first year or the second year. Where exact dates are not known, record approximate dates.

**Slide 9: Minimum DACS Element Required**

There are four required elements when describing the creators of archival material one must use to comply with ISAAR\[CPF\] guidelines. See Video 11 in this series for more information on the four elements required for creating DACS-compliant archival authority records. These elements must convey standardized information about the creator being described. We will go into more detail on the first three elements as we progress through this tutorial.

One thing to keep in mind is the following requirements specify particular elements that should be used in output products intended for the use of archivists or researchers in managing and using descriptions of archival creators. They articulate a “minimum” or “added value” usage of the elements defined by DACS but are not intended to preclude use of other descriptive data that a repository deems necessary for its own descriptive systems or products. DACS does not specify the order or arrangement of elements in a particular descriptive output.

**Slide 10: Form of Name (Section 10)**

Section 10 addresses the form of name for the archival authority record. All authority records must include an Authorized Form of the Name of the entity; here information about the entity is uniquely identified. Record the name of the entity being described in the authority record in accordance with standardized vocabularies or with rules for formulating standardized names such as those found in RDA, or ISAAR(CPF). Name entry may include dates, place, jurisdiction, occupation, epithet, or other qualifiers. You will need to identify the Type of Entity described in the authority record as either corporate body, person or family. In cases where materials have been classified under one name but a user might reasonably expect to find material using another name, include the information under Variant Names. If the authority record is for a corporate body, record, where possible, an official or other identifier for the corporate body and the jurisdiction that assigned it. For this country, the identifier would be the MARC Code List for Organizations.

**Slide 11: Text or Code, Up to You**

Type of Entity and Identifiers for Corporate Bodies can be recorded in either code or text. This means you can record the information in a way that is not necessarily human readable.

**Slide 12: Dates of Existence (1.1)**

Record Dates of Existence for the entity being described in terms of the calendar preferred by the agency creating the data. Don’t forget that dates should be formatted by following the guidelines set forth by ISO 8601 as described earlier. For persons record birth and death dates. For corporations record date of establishment and dissolution as well as major events. Record significant dates associated with families.

**Slide 13: Description of Person, Family, or Corporate Body (Section 11)**

Section 11 deals with the description of person, family, or corporate body, we will go into a bit more detail for these elements.

**Slide 14: Tie it all Together**

Historical summaries are recorded in narrative form. Be sure to include main life events, activities, functions, achievements, and/or roles of the entity being described. Include dates when possible.

**Slide 15: Places (11.3)**

Record the name of the Places or jurisdictions associated with the entity being described. For persons this may include place of birth, place of death, associated country, or place of residence. Families may include place of residence as well while corporate bodies may include information about the place of incorporation, locations of headquarters, location of conferences or the name of the jurisdiction. Places can be recorded in codes or by text but should be done so using appropriate companion standards such as RDA, or controlled vocabularies. Note the nature and/or the dates of the location as appropriate.

**Slide 16: Legal Status (11.4)**

For corporate bodies, record the legal status and, where appropriate, the type of corporate body together with the covering dates when the status applied. Use controlled vocabularies and defined date structures where possible.

**Slide 17: Functions, Occupations, and Activities (11.5)**

The same rules for controlled vocabularies and date structures should be used when recording the Functions, Occupations, and Activities performed by the entity.

**Slide 18: Mandates/Source of Authority (11.6)**

If the entity is a corporate body, under the Mandates or Source of Authority, using controlled vocabulary, record any law, act or other legal directive on which the authority of a corporate body rests. Although not required, you may also wish to include any jurisdictions (from controlled vocabulary) or dates (based on rules in 11.1).

**Slide 19: Internal Structure/Genealogy (11.7)**

Internal Structure or Genealogy is an element described in a narrative form which records the internal structure or genealogy of the entity being described, noting any significant changes to the structure, and relationships within the structure. When dates are known, be sure to include them.

**Slide 20: Related Persons, Families, and Corporate Bodies (Section 12)**

Section 12 deals with related persons, families, and corporate bodies and describes relationships with other corporate bodies, persons and families as they may be described in other authority records. Record the Names or Identifiers of Related Corporate Bodies, Persons, or Families and any relevant unique identifiers, including the authority record identifier. These entities should have significant relationships with the entity named in the authority record. \\

Names should adhere to controlled vocabulary standards. For each name, the Type of Related Entity Record is needed to distinguish the entity as a person, corporate body or family. The entity must also have a Description of the Relationship which in a general format will either be listed as hierarchical, temporal, family, or associative. Alternatively, a more precise description may be included incorporating terms from companion standards or controlled vocabulary. Narrative descriptions are also permissible. No matter which form you choose, include any known beginning and end dates (based on rules in 11.1)
