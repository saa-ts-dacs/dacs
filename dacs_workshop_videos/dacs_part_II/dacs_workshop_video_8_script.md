Hello, my name is Maristella Feustle and I am the Music Special Collections Librarian at the University of North Texas. Welcome to the eighth video in the Society of American Archivists instructional video series on Describing Archives: A Content Standard.

In this video we will be going over the importance of involvement by practitioners like you in shaping the future of archival authority in DACS. Once this video is over, you should understand how to get involved in the ongoing conversation about archival authority in the SAA through several avenues. This video is free and available to anyone who wants to learn more about DACS, but if you sign up to take the DACS workshop for credit, you will be responsible for understanding this content, and there will be a quiz to test your understanding.

In archival work, context is key, and a major source of context for an archival collection is the human element -- histories, personalities, activities -- that generated the materials in question. Accordingly, Describing Archives: a Content Standard, or DACS, Principle 8 states that “The creators of archival materials, as well as the materials themselves, must be described,” and Part II of the present version of DACS covers archival authority records in detail in chapters 9 through 14.

The International Standard Archival Authority Records for Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families, or ISAAR-CPF, goes into detail, calling authority work “an essential activity” of archivists for three reasons:

-   To describe the creator or creators of an archival collection — corporate bodies, persons, or families — within an archival descriptive system

-   To control the creation and use of access points in archival descriptions

-   To show relationships between different creators, and between the people and the documents they created, and/or other resources about or by them.

To make a long story short, archival authority is a big deal, with requirements particular to our field. It is also an area of ongoing development and refinement in archival practice: While DACS was first approved in 2004, it underwent a major revision in 2013, and is now on a continuous revision cycle. The companion standard to DACS Part II is Encoded Archival Context for Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families, abbreviated EAC-CPF. It is the machine-readable archival authority record framework approved by the SAA, which was adopted in 2011, and has also been under revision according to user feedback and experience. As DACS’ Principle 7.1 observes that archival description is “an iterative and dynamic process,” so too is the development of effective standards for describing archival materials and their creators.

That’s where you come in. There is no secret handshake required to get involved. Useful standards arise from the actual practices of a given field, and that requires communication with actual practitioners, like you.

How can you get involved? First, follow along with the work of the SAA committees tasked with developing and maintaining the relevant standards, namely, the Technical Subcommittee on Describing Archives: A Content Standard, and the Technical Subcommittee on EAC-CPF, both of which operate under the umbrella of the SAA Standards Committee. Join their respective email discussion lists, and attend SAA’s annual meetings.

Above all, become familiar with part II of DACS, seek out examples, and if possible, implement its specifications in your own work. See what works, and what needs further clarification. Learning about these standards is also “an iterative and dynamic process,” and everyone has to start somewhere. The sooner you start, the sooner you can join this vitally important conversation.
