**Slide 1: Introduction**

Hello, my name is Emily Gonzalez and I am the archivist at the Cambridge Historical Commission. Welcome to the ninth video in the Society of American Archivists instructional video series on Describing Archives: A Content Standard.

**Slide 2: What Are Archival Authority Records**

In this video we will be going over the very basics of archival authority records -- what they are, what they do, the differences between archival authority records and library records, and the benefits of having archival authority records.

Once this video is over, you should understand how to identify an archival authority record, the most important components of a record and how to display the records. This all points back to the outcome of Principal 8 in the DACS Statement of Principles: that the *creators* of archival materials, as well as the materials themselves, must be described.

This video is free and available to anyone who wants to learn more about DACS, but if you sign up to take the DACS workshop for credit, you will be responsible for understanding this content, and there will be a quiz to test your understanding.

**Slide 4: Archival Authority Records**

So, let’s dig in. By now you should have an understanding of how to describe archival materials, from Part 1 of DACS. Let’s talk about how to describe the *creators* of our materials. We can do this through archival authority records.

Archival authority records give us the additional information and context necessary to fully understand the creation and use of the archival materials being described, all the way from their beginnings as a collection in Hollinger boxes, to the finding aid, to the final authority record.

**Slide 5: What IS an Archival Authority Record? According to DACS...**

So what exactly is an archival authority record and what does it do? Well, it’s all about context and connections.

According to DACS: The archival authority record is a description of a personal, family, or corporate entity associated with a body of archival materials, typically where that name is used as an access point to a description of those records.

**Slide 6: Details, Details...**

The archival authority record does the following: it identifies and describes a person, corporate body, or family (otherwise known as an “entity”) associated with the archival materials -- in this context, “associated” typically meaning the “entity” created, has, or had custody of the materials.

So for example, for a person or family entity, the authority record assembles biographical information. For a corporate body, the authority record gives data about the history, structure, functions, and relationships of that relevant organization. Authority records can also be created to document entities that are the subject, not just the creator, of archival materials.

In addition, the authority record also documents relationships between these entities and their archival materials, controls the form of the name locally, and relies on consistency and uniqueness.

**Slide 7: \[Wilfrid Laurier University Authority Record\]**

In this slide, we have an example of an archival authority record. We will be going over some of these elements and components in the next few slides.

**Slide 8: What is Required in an Archival Authority Record?**

So what is in an archival authority record and what is required?

DACS prescribes only the elements of information that need to be recorded and *not* the precise formats in which they are stored or presented. The International Standard Archival Authority Record for Corporate Bodies, Persons and Families (or ISAAR(CPF)) identifies the four types of information found in an archival authority record, listed here.

We'll break these down over the next few slides.

**Slide 9: Identity (Name)**

The first required element in your authority record is the identity, or the name. This is the authoritative standardized form of the name and any variant names. So, for example, when you create your archival authority record, you’ll first identify the creators (the person, family, corporate body) and then create an authority record for each one associated with the creation of the archival materials

**Slide 10: Description**

The next type of information is: Description. This is the history and activities of the entity being described in the archival material. Remember, the “entity” is the person, family or corporate body who is usually the subject of the authority record -- the person or corporate body that created or had custody of your archival materials.

This section of the record includes an administrative or biographical history of the organizations or individuals associated with the creation/custody/assembly and/or maintenance and use of the archival unit being described.

**Slide 11: Relationships**

The next element is relationships: the relationships of the entity to other entities and information resources. This can include earlier names or other forms of names in your archival collection.

**Slide 12: Control**

And the final required element is control. This is documentation of how the authority record was created and maintained (by you or your staff). It could include local identifiers, the rules and conventions used like DACS, the dates the records were created, and other useful information.

**Slide 13: Why Is the Authority Record Useful?**

So why is the authority record useful? Well, through the DACS archival authority record, you can capture useful information about creators of archival materials and maintain them in a *separate* system of authority records that are linked to the archival descriptions, rather than just being embedded within them.

So for example, you could have a separate authority record in your library catalog or website that links to your finding aid, rather than just keeping the creator’s information within the finding aid or catalog record.

**Slide 14: Archival Authority Record vs. Library (Bibliographic) Authority Record**

You might then ask, what’s the difference between an archival authority record and a library authority record?

In the archival authority record, there is a greater emphasis on contextual information, as well as a more detailed relationships model (more detailed, say, than in RDA).

There is also the bounding of entities. The description of entities, the person or corporate body for example, in the archival authority record documents the context of records creation in archival description and control systems. While the archival authority record standardizes access points, just like a library authority record, it generally contains much more information.

**Slide 15: Advantages of Creating Archival Authority Records**

So what are the advantages of creating archival authority records for your archival materials? There are several reasons:

-   They reduce duplication and potential for errors.

-   They document relationships: linking one-to-many and many-to-one.

-   They create a single point of access for physically disparate materials.

-   They reduce record maintenance and create a more structured description of record-creation context.

-   They can help identify complex entities, such as name changes in record creators.

-   And they facilitate data exchange.

**Slide 16: Where Are Archival Authority Records Found?**

So now that you know the basics of archival authority records and the advantages of using them, how do you display them and where are they found?

There are a couple of ways to display and access your authority records: first, electronically as part of a publicly accessible information system such as finding aids or an OPAC and also paper based such as a Shelf list or internal file for staff or print finding aids with a "see also" section.

**Slide 17: Next Up**

In the next video, you’ll be able to answer the question: What does archival description look like in archival authority records?
