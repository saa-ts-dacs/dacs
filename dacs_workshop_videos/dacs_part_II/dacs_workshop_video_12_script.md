Hello, my name is Maristella Feustle, and I am the Music Special Collections Librarian at the University of North Texas. Welcome to the twelfth video in the Society of American Archivists instructional video series on Describing Archives: A Content Standard.

In this video we will be going over relationships between various name authority standards. Once this video is over, you should be familiar with the names of the major authority standards, why name authority control is important to archival work, and the unique needs of archival description which underlie archival authority records. This video is free and available to anyone who wants to learn more about DACS, but if you sign up to take the DACS workshop for credit, you will be responsible for understanding this content, and there will be a quiz to test your understanding.

DACS, or Describing Archives: A Content Standard, begins with a statement of principles. Several of them are useful to inform our discussion of archival authorities. Principle 1 states that “Records in archives possess unique characteristics.” Principle 8 specifies that “The creators of archival materials, as well as the materials themselves, must be described.” Both the materials and the creators have descriptive needs which are particular to the archival setting.

For that matter, the International Standard Archival Authority Records for Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families, or ISAAR-CPF, calls authority work “an essential activity” of archivists for three reasons:

-   To describe the creator or creators of an archival collection — corporate bodies, persons, or families — within an archival descriptive system

-   To control the creation and use of access points in archival descriptions

-   To show relationships between different creators, and between the people and the documents they created, and/or other resources about or by them.

It is clear, then, that archival authority is tremendously important, and serves specific needs of archival collections: Many name authority standards exist to verify and communicate positive identification, but the archival profession’s particular contribution to this area is the comprehensive depth of archival authority records in response to the unique needs of our community and collections since, as DACS’ principle 8 acknowledges, the description of creator and materials mutually enhance our understanding of both.

No standard is an island unto itself, however; it must interact with the standards and practices of other disciplines. We will start by placing DACS part II — Archival Authority Records — in the context of related archival authority projects, and explore some of the major authority standards which have developed in other disciplines.

First, some terminology:

-   ISAD(G) stands for General International Standard Archival Description.

-   ISAAR-CPF, once again, is International Standard Archival Authority Records for Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families

-   DACS, or Describing Archives: a Content Standard, is the North American expression of ISAD-G and ISAAR-CPF adopted by the Society of American Archivists. DACS is format-neutral, and DACS-compliant document can exist in a variety of formats.

Encoded Archival Context for Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families — EAC-CPF— is also based on ISAAR-CPF, but makes archival authority records machine-readable. Specifically, it is constructed in eXtensible Markup Language, or XML, a widely-used, non-proprietary format. It is a counterpart to Encoded Archival Description, which is mainly concerned with the description of archival materials, and both are governed by technical subcommittees of SAA.

While DACS Part II and EAC developed separately, they have a common ancestor in ISAAR-CPF, and therefore complement one another very well. EAC remains as much more of a work in progress than EAD, having been adopted by the SAA in 2011. But while an EAC authority file is a useful document unto itself, two projects show the potential of what many EAC records may accomplish together. One is OCLC’s Archive Grid, which has aggregated EAD finding aids from all over the world, so that one may easily browse and discover a broad range of, for example, science fiction-related collections in one place. Imagine being able to apply the same concept to names and relationships. Another is the SNAC project, Social Networks and Archival Context, which uses EAC records to link people to people under a variety of relationships and associations, broadening the context of individual records, and enhancing discoverability.

Archival authority standards co-exist alongside a variety of other standards in library cataloging and metadata. The best known in the United States is, of course, Library of Congress Authorities, which are most often seen in MARC, or MAchine Readable Cataloging format, but may also be presented in MADS format: Metadata Authority Description Standards, which LC describes as “MARC21-compatible XML format for the type of data carried in the MARC 21 Authority format.” Again, XML continues to be of central importance in interoperability of standards.

As technology makes the world smaller, the more important it becomes for authority systems of all kinds to be able to talk to one another, so to speak: that is, to coordinate rather than duplicating efforts, and to realize the potential in linking the data they hold.

One such example is VIAF, the Virtual International Authority File, which federates the major authority control systems of numerous national and other major libraries on every continent except Antarctica. An additional contributor to VIAF is ISNI, the International Standard Name Identifier. As ISBN provides for books, ISNI exists to provide each creator name with “a persistent, unique, identifying number,” so that “every published work can be unambiguously attributed to its creator wherever that work is described.” Here, one may begin to see the potential of coordinating unambiguously positive identification, confirmed across global institutions, with the depth of archival authority standards.

Other standards exist to address discipline-specific needs, while also having the potential to link out to confirm and enrich other bodies of data. ORCID, or Open Researcher and Contributor ID, specifically exists for the positive identification of researchers, to ensure proper attribution in a global environment of similar or duplicate names, changing names, variable transliterations among international alphabets, and so on. Additional products in this area include ResearcherID, Digital Author Identifier, and the Lattes Platform of Brazil.

What does authority work mean for archivists, and how can it help us better serve our users? First, given the vital importance of describing the creator of an archival collection in addition to the archival materials, a DACS-compliant authority record serves to enhance users’ understanding of the materials before them, and demonstrate a collection’s significance not just as a set of things, but as a record of human activity – a biography told in the creator’s own documents and artifacts.

In addition, the ability to make those enriched authority records machine-readable through EAC-CPF, and to link out to other authorities greatly enhances discoverability, and increases researchers’ chances of finding your collections. Context becomes even broader as data is linked and shared, and archival authority records have the potential to be of service to users outside the archival profession in that they go the extra mile in both identifying and describing a creator – what library catalogers sometimes call “is-ness” and “about-ness.”
