### Processing Information

**7.1.8** Provide information about actions of the archivist, custodians, or creators of the records or conventions in the finding aid that may have an impact on a researcher's interpretation of the records or understanding of the information provided in the finding aid.

<p class="dacs-example">Actions and conventions include but are not limited to reconstruction of provenance, maintenance, reconstruction, or alteration of original order, devising titles for materials, weeding, and maintenance or provision of control numbers or container numbers.</p>

#### **Exclusions**

Some actions noted according to this rule may reference arrangement; however, for identification of the current system of arrangement, see Element 3.2.

#### **Examples**

<p class="dacs-example">The records of the League of Women Voters received by the Library between 1933 and 1968 were described in a preliminary finding aid that was updated in 1994 with the addition of material received between 1979 and 1990.</p>

<p class="dacs-example"><em>Processing information for the</em> League of Women Voters (U.S.) records, Library of Congress</p>

<p class="dacs-example">Upon arrival in the Library of Congress, the Gifford Pinchot Papers were placed in manuscript containers, with a descriptive container listing providing the only access to the collection. Substantial portions of the papers were reorganized in 1973 into a more coherent arrangement, and new series were created to bring similar material together.</p>

<p class="dacs-example">In 1989 the Library of Congress, in conjunction with the United States Forest Service, undertook a cooperative project to organize and describe those portions of the Pinchot Papers that concerned the early period of the conservation movement and the first five years of the Forest Service from 1890 to 1910. Selected records and files were rearranged to document Pinchot's contribution to the founding of the conservation movement. Due to the interfiling, transposition, and removal of material that resulted from this reorganization, gaps occurred in the former sequence of arrangement of the manuscript containers. These gaps are identified in the container list by the statement "removed from collection." Final processing of this segment of the Pinchot Papers was completed in 1991.</p>

<p class="dacs-example">In addition to the rearrangement of a portion of the collection between 1989 and 1991, new material was appended in 1985 and 1998. Other revisions were made in 2007, and the finding aid was revised again in 2011.</p>

Alteration or maintenance of arrangement examples:

<p class="dacs-example">Unless otherwise noted in the series and subseries descriptions, the arrangement scheme for the collection was imposed during processing in the absence of a usable original order.</p>

<p class="dacs-example"><em>Processing information for the</em> Frederick Reines papers</p>

<p class="dacs-example">The original arrangement and folder titles were retained in most cases. Exceptions include legal-sized material, which was re-housed into appropriate containers.</p>

<p class="dacs-example"><em>Processing information for the</em> Papers of George Wald, Harvard University Archives</p>

<p class="dacs-example">The original chronological arrangement of the series was maintained during processing. The sole exception to this arrangement is several files of correspondence with physicists that Reines maintained separately from the chronological files, which are arranged alphabetically by the physicists' surnames at the end of the series.</p>

<p class="dacs-example"><em>Processing information for the</em> Frederick Reines papers</p>

Restoration of provenance examples:

<p class="dacs-example">These records were previously dispersed, both physically and intellectually, and classified under numerous call numbers. All of the records were reprocessed in 2011 and brought together as a single collection.</p>

<p class="dacs-example"><em>Processing information for the</em> Records of early Harvard buildings, Harvard University Archives</p>

<p class="dacs-example">This collection was previously listed in the Harvard University Archives shelflist among the records of the Harvard College Library but otherwise uncataloged. It was processed in 2010. Processing involved a collection survey and arrangement into series and subseries, re-housing in appropriate archival folders and boxes, and the creation of this finding aid.</p>

<p class="dacs-example"><em>Processing information for the</em> Papers of Samuel Shapleigh, Harvard University Archives</p>

Custodian or creator actions examples:

<p class="dacs-example">The items in boxes one through three were arranged by Joseph Burlingham in the order in which he planned to use them for his book.</p>

<p class="dacs-example"><em>Processing information for the</em> Joseph Lancaster papers, 1796-1840, American Antiquarian Society</p>

<p class="dacs-example">Roger W. Hickman, a member of the department from 1927-1966, gathered these records together at the time of his retirement. Folder titles and arrangement were assigned by Hickman and were not changed by the Archives staff, except for the cyclotron records.</p>

<p class="dacs-example"><em>Processing information for the</em> Records of the Harvard University Dept. of Physics, Harvard University Archives</p>

<p class="dacs-example">George Wald designated files of correspondence with prominent or famous people as "VIP." The archivist noted this designation in the folder list.</p>

Finding aid conventions examples:

<p class="dacs-example">Unless otherwise noted, the parenthetical notations of relationship indicate that person's relationship to Francis Ellingwood Abbot.</p>

<p class="dacs-example"><em>Processing information for the</em> Francis Ellingwood Abbot papers, Andover-Harvard Theological Library, Harvard Divinity School</p>

<p class="dacs-example">Folder headings in quotation marks were found on the original folders; these headings appear to have been assigned by Frances Parsons Davis. All other headings have been devised by the processor.</p>

<p class="dacs-example"><em>Processing information for the</em> Dorothy Adlow papers, Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute</p>

<p class="dacs-example">The contents of some folders labeled "miscellaneous" were interfiled in this subseries by the archivist. Folder titles enclosed in square brackets were devised by the archivist.</p>

<p class="dacs-example"><em>Processing information for the</em> Records of the Association of Harvard Chemists, Harvard University Archives</p>

Container number alteration examples:

<p class="dacs-example">Material received in 1977 was processed as an addition in 1994. The finding aid was further revised and containers housing the addition were renumbered in 2010.</p>

<p class="dacs-example"><em>Processing information for the</em> Papers of Kermit and Belle Roosevelt, Library of Congress</p>

<p class="dacs-example">These papers of Betty Friedan were previously designated by an accession number range: "71-62--81-M23." ... The papers arrived in no order; most documents were not in folders. They were roughly sorted and screened so they could be made available for research use. Folder titles were created by the archivist. In 2009, the archivist reboxed the collection, added more description to folder titles and scope and content notes, and intellectually rearranged some folders; the physical arrangement was retained. Basic folder numbers remain the same as in "71-62--81-M23," but for preservation purposes, many overly full folders have been divided, adding alphabetical designations to the previously assigned numbers (e.g., #149a-149b).</p>
