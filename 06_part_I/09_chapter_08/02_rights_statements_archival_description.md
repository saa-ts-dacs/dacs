# 8.2 Rights Statements for Archival Description (Single-Level Minimum Required)

## Purpose and Scope

This element identifies the conditions under which the archival description itself is available for use and reuse.  Repositories should establish a consistent policy about the rights granted.

If a formal license is used, this element should include both the source of the license and the institutional policies governing the type of license chosen.  Repositories should establish a consistent policy regarding the type of license chosen and its format.

If an institution wishes to claim rights on archival description outside of a specific license, the repository should create explicit and consistent rights statements.

## Exclusions

**8.2.1** Rules about the use of the archival materials themselves (Conditions Governing Use and Conditions Governing Access elements) are found in DACS 4.4.

## Sources of Information

**8.2.2** Take the information from institutional policies and if applicable, the rules governing the licensing source or rights jurisdiction.

## General Rules

Record the necessary information documented by the selected license.
