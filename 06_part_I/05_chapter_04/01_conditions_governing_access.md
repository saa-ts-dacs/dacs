# 4.1 Conditions Governing Access (Required)

## Purpose and Scope

This element provides information about access restrictions due to the nature of the information in the materials being described, such as those imposed by the donor, by the repository, or by statutory/regulatory requirements.

Commentary: In many cases it will be necessary or desirable to provide a very succinct statement regarding access restrictions rather than a lengthy explanation. This would particularly be the case for a MARC 21 record when restrictions are complex or likely to change over time.

## Exclusions

**4.1.1** Record any physical conditions affecting the use of the materials being described in the Physical Access Element (4.2).

**4.1.2** Record any technical requirements affecting the use of the materials being described in the Technical Access Element (4.3).

**4.1.3** Record any restrictions governing reproduction, publication, or other uses after access is given in the Conditions Governing Reproduction and Use Element (4.4).

## Sources of Information

**4.1.4** Derive the information from a reliable source, such as donor agreements, statutes, and regulations and repository policies.

## General Rules

**4.1.5** Give information about any restrictions on access to the unit being described (or parts thereof) as a result of the nature of the information therein or statutory/contractual requirements. As appropriate, specify the details of the restriction, including the length of the period of closure or the date when it will be lifted; the authority that imposed and enforces the conditions governing access; contact information for the person or office to whom the restriction may be appealed; authorized users; and so on. If there are no restrictions, state that fact.
