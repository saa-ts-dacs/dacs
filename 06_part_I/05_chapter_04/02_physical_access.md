# 4.2 Physical Access (Added Value)

## Purpose and Scope

*   Location (e.g., offsite, cold storage)
*   Physical condition of the material that limits use
*   Requirement to use copies instead of originals for preservation reasons

## Exclusions

**4.2.1** Record any access restrictions due to the nature of the information in the Conditions Governing Access Element (4.1).

**4.2.2** Record any technical requirements affecting the use of the materials being described in the Technical Access Element (4.3).

**4.2.3** Record any restrictions governing reproduction, publication, or other uses after access is given in the Conditions Governing Reproduction and Use Element (4.4).

## Sources of Information

**4.2.4** Derive the information from the materials themselves and repository policy.

## General Rules

**4.2.5** Provide information about the physical characteristics or condition of the unit being described that limit access to it or restrict its use.

<p class="dacs-example">Records are heavily foxed.</p>
<p class="dacs-example">Some of the letters in this series are illegible due to water damage.</p>

**4.2.6** Provide information about the location of the unit being described, if that location affects access to it.

<p class="dacs-example">The audio cassettes are located in cold vault storage and must be acclimated before delivery to the research room.</p>
<p class="dacs-example">Forty-eight hours' advance notice is required for access because materials are stored offsite.</p>

**4.2.7** If the original materials may not be used at all for preservation reasons, provide information about the reasons and the availability of reproductions.
