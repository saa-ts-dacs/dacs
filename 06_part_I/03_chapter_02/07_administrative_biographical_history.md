# 2.7 Administrative/Biographical History (Optimum)

## Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this element is to describe the required elements of a biographical or administrative history note about creators embedded in the description of materials. The administrative/biographical history provides relevant information about corporate bodies, persons, or families who are identified using the Name of Creator(s) Element and who therefore function as nominal access points. This element also describes the relationship of creators to archival materials by providing information about the context in which those materials were created.

Commentary: Information about the corporate body, person, or family that created, assembled, accumulated, and/or maintained and used the materials being described may be described in one of two ways:

1.  Incorporated into the description using biographical/historical notes. These rules are covered here in Element 2.7.

2.  Held in a separate system of authority files that are linked to the archival descriptions and displayed together. These rules are covered in Part II.

Archivists may wish to devise more or less detail, depending on the system being used and other local variables. For example, the administrative/biographical history information in a catalog record describing the materials should be brief, while an authority record or creator sketch in a multilevel finding aid may be much more extensive, consisting of a narrative description, chronology, or both.

There may be instances in describing collections where providing information about the collector is not necessary—for example, when the repository is the collector.

## Exclusions

**2.7.1** Record information about the scope and content of the materials in the Scope and Content Element (3.1).

**2.7.2** Record information about the structure or arrangement of the materials in the System of Arrangement Element (3.2).

**2.7.3** Record information about the custodial history in the Custodial History Element (5.1).

## Sources of Information

**2.7.4** Assemble the information from reliable sources, such as the materials themselves and reference works. Establish a consistent policy regarding the content, form, and placement of citation of sources and quotations.

## Rules for Biographical Historical Notes Done Within the Description

**2.7.5** Where the administrative/biographical history is provided within the description, provide administrative/biographical history at the highest levels of description as instructed in rules 2.7.6 to 2.7.33.

**2.7.6** At the highest level of description, give information about the history of the corporate body(ies), person(s), or family(ies) that created, assembled, accumulated, and/or maintained and used the material as a whole.

**2.7.7** Optionally, at subsequent levels of description, if the creator of the subordinate unit is different from the creator of the material as a whole, give information about the history of the corporate body(ies), person(s), or family(ies) that created, assembled, accumulated, and/or maintained and used that subordinate unit.

**2.7.8** When primary responsibility for the creation, assembly, accumulation, and/or maintenance and use of the materials is shared between two or more corporate bodies, or two or more persons, or two or more families, create separate administrative/biographical histories for each corporate body, person, or family.

**2.7.9** When primary responsibility for the creation, assembly, accumulation, and/or maintenance and use of the materials is shared between two or more members of a family, create separate biographical histories for the family and for each person.

## Selection of the Subelements

**2.7.10** Include in the Administrative/Biographical History all of the following subelements<sup>1</sup> that are relevant to the corporate body, person, or family being described and that provide the information necessary to explain the context in which the materials were created, assembled, accumulated, and/or maintained and used.
