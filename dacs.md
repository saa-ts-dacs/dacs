## About This Standard

The Society of American Archivists adopted Describing Archives: A Content Standard (DACS) as the official content standard of the U.S. archival community in 2005. DACS was designed to be used to create a variety of archival descriptions, including finding aids and catalog records. It replaced *Archives, Personal Papers, and Manuscripts*,<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> which had served the U.S. archival community for more than two decades. 

In 2013, following a call from the Council of the Society of American Archivists and after soliciting feedback from the community, DACS underwent a major revision. The revisions addressed the growing convergence between archival, museum, and library descriptive standards—particularly the promulgation and adoption of RDA.<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup> Another significant issue was the development and adoption of Encoded Archival Context<sup>[3](#myfootnote3)</sup> and the need to provide guidance on the creation of archival authority records. 

## Continuous Revision Cycle

In 2013, DACS was moved to a continuous revision cycle; this means that DACS may be revised as needs from the community arise. The most current version of DACS (and a history of revisions) can be found on the TS-DACS GitHub site.<sup>[4](#myfootnote4)</sup>

The subcommittee continues to monitor the development of other descriptive standards, particularly Records in Contexts (RiC)<sup>[5](#myfootnote5)</sup> and RDA, to ensure compatibility and reduce duplication where necessary. 

## Ecosystem of Interrelated Standards for Providing Access to Archives

As a content standard, DACS is part of an ecosystem of interrelated and, in some cases, interdependent standards which support the process of archival description. Sometimes referred to as “companion standards,” these include structure standards, other content standards, and communication standards.

### Relationship to Other Descriptive Standards

#### ISAD(G) and ISAAR(CPF)

DACS relies on two international content standards for archival description: *International Standard Archival Description-General (ISAD(G))*<sup>[6](#myfootnote6)</sup> and the *International Standard Archival Authority Record for Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families (ISAAR(CPF))*.<sup>[7](#myfootnote7)</sup> All of the data elements of ISAD(G) and ISAAR(CPF) are incorporated into DACS—in some cases, virtually verbatim. Part I of DACS was initially developed to mirror the components of ISAD(G) and Part II was designed to mirror ISAAR(CPF). This structure and concordance is maintained in the revised version of DACS.

The review of the ICA descriptive standards and the development and adoption of the Encoded Archival Context encoding standard by the Society of American Archivists led TS-DACS to heavily revise Part II of DACS in 2013. Part II of DACS contains rules for the creation of archival authority records and is broken into six chapters to align with ISAAR(CPF).<sup>[8](#myfootnote8)</sup>

#### Records in Contexts (RiC)

Following the draft release of its conceptual model in 2016, DACS and Records in Contexts (RiC) are now entering a period of coevolution. Much of the 2018 revision of the Statement of Principles on Archival Description attempts to bring DACS in closer alignment with RiC. Of particular importance is the structuring of Principle 4, which outlines three entities that must be described: records, agents, and activities, as well as the relationships between them. This structure allows archivists to create more complex and networked representation of records, including both their content and context(s). As opposed to archival description represented as hierarchy, this network of linked entities and the relationships between them will allow for deeper understanding and discovery of records and their creators.

#### Other Companion Standards

Archivists should look to DACS for guidance about how to describe the qualities of archives as records -- their creation, provenance, maintenance, and relationship to other records and creators. Archivists should consult companion standards for guidance on creating authorized forms of names and portraying the particular artifactual characteristics of specialized materials (like music, archived websites, or any example of the vast variety of other materials that may be found in an archive’s holdings).<sup>[9](#myfootnote9)</sup>

## Implementation Neutrality

DACS is implementation-neutral and can be expressed in any data format that maps to its record structure. It has been most closely implemented by, and co-evolved with, the *Encoded Archival Description* (EAD)<sup>[10](#myfootnote10)</sup> suite of XML schemata but can equally be encoded in MARC21,<sup>[11](#myfootnote11)</sup> RDF,<sup>[12](#myfootnote12)</sup> a database-backed archives management system, or any other communication standard. Whereas DACS primarily serves a U.S. audience, the stakeholders of many encoding standards represent an international community rooted in sometimes diverging descriptive practices. This has necessitated encoding implementations that err on the side of permissiveness, and practitioners may opt to strengthen the alignment between the respective encoding standard of their choice and DACS by producing a narrower implementation of the chosen encoding standard at the local level.

## The Relationship between the Principles and the Rules

*Describing Archives: A Content Standard* provides a set of principles and elements (with rules for formulating elements) that unite archival professionals in the United States with common understanding and practice toward the creation of descriptions of archival holdings. 

Principles are fundamental propositions that support and shape the practices of a profession and reflect its basic values. One key value shared by archivists is their responsibility to provide maximum access to the holdings in their custody.<sup>[13](#myfootnote13)</sup> An essential precondition for providing access is the sufficient and effective description of their holdings. The eleven principles that precede DACS represent the fundamental propositions that, if collectively adhered to, can help ensure the success of archival description in promoting user access. The elements and rules of DACS, in turn, elaborate on those principles, providing the practical instructions required to produce archival description that realizes the sense and purpose of the principles.

Collectively, the principles, elements, and rules of DACS provide a framework to guide practitioners through a range of activities from concrete descriptive tasks to the development of repository-wide descriptive programs. Adherence to DACS promotes consistency for users, ensures interoperability with systems for maintenance and display, and helps to maintain the authenticity and integrity of records. The inherent flexibility of DACS requires practitioners to use their professional judgment and expertise when writing principled, standards-compliant description. Local implementation guidelines remain integral to the success of *Describing Archives: A Content Standard*.

This led to the most obvious change from DACS 2004—the removal of Part III.

# Statement of Principles

## Introduction

### What is archival description and what should it do? 

Archival description exists to facilitate the use of archives by people in order to understand the past through traces in records. Its efficacy can be measured by how well it achieves that goal. *Describing Archives: A Content Standard* provides a set of principles for archivists to consider when conducting the work of a descriptive program, and a set of elements (and rules for creating these elements) for archivists to use when creating archival description. 

Archival description enables archivists to distill masses of information about records into a small set of characteristics describing aggregations of records. Archivists do this work because it would often be impractical to fully represent the entirety of each record in a repository and because it would be difficult for a user to make sense of masses of records without a guide to what they *are*, what they *mean* and the historical *process* by which they were created and maintained.<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> For this distillation to be intelligible, archivists must understand the evidence of people, places, ideas and activities provided by records so that they can adequately represent the records to users and communicate their nature, value, and significance. Good archival description cannot just depict the physical and intellectual characteristics of documents. It must communicate how the accumulation of documents in a collection represents and provides evidence of the major functions of an organization or individual. This contextual description is key to meaning-making and gives users the tools necessary to effectively evaluate the value of records as evidence and information.

Archivists describe information about the lifecycle and administration of records that may not be present in the records themselves. Information about appraisal, custodial history, administrative interventions, restrictions, reformatting, or any other activity that has the power to change users’ understanding of records’ content or context should be faithfully documented and presented to the user. Without this information, the user may not be able to make a reliable determination about the historical events, ideas, places, and people that records document. Descriptive work should document a program of archival administration that maintains the authenticity, integrity, and reliability of records.

### User-centered archival description

Because it facilitates use, archival description is a user-centered product and process. This approach to archival description helps archivists remain connected to communities of users throughout the entire lifecycle of archives administration, dynamically and iteratively adjusting to new understanding of users and their needs. 

Uses for and users of records should be considered comprehensively, and will vary from repository to repository. Users include not only those outside the repository, but the repository’s own staff. It is imperative that repositories identify, engage, and seek to understand the motivations and needs of *their* users, which may include but are not limited to scholarly production, collection care and control, institutional knowledge, connection to family ties, artistic endeavors, government accountability, justice-seeking endeavors, and symbolic purposes of holding records.

### Identifying aggregations of records

When describing archives, archivists provide a sensemaking function -- they help the user understand, at deepening levels of granularity, what these records are, who created them, what events they represent, and what they mean. 

In order to do this, they must first identify aggregations of records. This is a core added value of archival labor -- the ability to explain masses of information to users in a manner that is both insightful and succinct.<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup> It is also a site of archives power, where the archivist has the opportunity to declare what is important and what is not.<sup>[3](#myfootnote3)</sup>

Archival theory and tradition privileges description of the relationship between creators of records and the traces they leave behind as a result of events and activities in their lives. Records are often produced and kept according to these qualities, and where common aggregations are discovered, it is useful to maintain them. It is less useful for an archivist to aggregate resources by their common subject, particularly because doing so often results in the loss of information about how and by whom records were created.

### Describing aggregations of records

Once an archivist has identified a meaningful aggregation of records, they may avail themselves of any relevant elements within the DACS element set in order to describe characteristics particular and appropriate to that aggregation. As described in Chapter 1, in the section on *Requirements for Multilevel Descriptions*, descriptions of a particular aggregation may (implicitly or explicitly) inherit characteristics from the more general aggregation of which it is a part. Furthermore, each aggregation should include all DACS single-level minimum elements, either described explicitly at that aggregation or inherited from associated archival description.

### Provenance

To achieve the goal of faithfully documenting and maintaining information about how individuals and groups created and maintained records, archival practice has relied on the guidance of *respect des fonds* for more than 150 years.<sup>[4](#myfootnote4)</sup> Keeping the records of a given creator separate from other records (physically, intellectually, and in descriptive systems) has been an excellent mechanism to ensure that contexts of creation and maintenance are maintained. 

However, the application of *respect des fonds* can often flatten existing complexity by obscuring the ways in which human inter-connections, disruptions, false starts, and confusing circumstances produced records in the first place. Users benefit from understanding the ways that records are created, collected, and distributed by multiple agents, beyond the bare details of their shared provenance.

All records within a fonds rarely come from the same creator, even if they are from the same collector and share provenance. In modern organizations, while it is undoubtedly useful to document the person or organization who brought together the group of records given to a repository, it would be even more useful to document the web of activities by which records are collected and created, and by whom, from within and outside of the organization and how structures of power and control brought records into existence. Because information systems have the power to document relationships and contexts between and across records and creators, *respect des fonds* should be considered one articulation of a method for documenting archival content and context, rather than a principle of archival description. One could imagine technical mechanisms by which this web of contexts, records, and creators could be represented in the entirety of its complexity, beyond the directive toward administrative separation that *respect des fonds* demands. 

This should not be taken as permission for archivists to create their own physical or intellectual order by subject, genre, form, or other facet -- doing so often destroys context. Instead, archivists should embrace the best information technologies available to them to document and represent records over time as they are understood to the archivist. 

### Original order and arrangement as archival context

The concept of original order has long been privileged in archival description as representing a state of arrangement with special significance in revealing the context underlying the creation of records. The principle of respect for original order derives from this interpretation. Recent theory and practice have shown this to be much more complex.<sup>[5](#myfootnote5)</sup> For instance, there are many arrangements by which a creator may have maintained and used records over time. The order in which records are received by a repository may not match the order in which they were last used or maintained by their creator(s), further complicating the very concept of “originality” and the narrative of authenticity it supports. Similarly, electronic records complicate the idea of a fixed, canonical order because they are commonly moved and maintained in a file system over the course of their life cycles.<sup>[6](#myfootnote6)</sup>

Rather than a privileged physical sequence of records, original order is best thought of as an intellectual construct that communicates important activities and relationships inhering in records through identifying key groupings that reflect the main activities and functions of the record creators.<sup>[7](#myfootnote7)</sup>

The principle of original order advises archivists to determine and preserve those groupings, and then to describe records, agents, activities, and the relationships between them in a way that illuminates how creators kept their records and how they were sent to the archives. They should never disrupt or obscure evidence of recordkeeping practices through their own interventions; for instance, it is inadvisable to alter the received order of collection material without a compelling, user-driven need to do so. 

By not elevating original order to the place of descriptive principle, DACS acknowledges that arrangement consists of a multitude of intellectual and physical relationships over time, and that arrangement itself is but one among many instances of archival context(s) to be documented.

## Principles of Archival Description

### 1. Archival description expresses professional ethics and values.

Professional values and ethics drive archival work, including descriptive practice.<sup>[8](#myfootnote8)</sup> Archival description is an iterative, ethical practice that requires continual engagement with core values. Rooting standards in values helps archivists enact these values consistently and makes them explicit to our user communities. 

Archival description that is rooted in ethics will produce a richer researcher experience because it: 
 - produces trust in and between users, archivists, and repositories
 - encourages a diverse archival record
 - promotes responsible and responsive descriptive practices
 - holds archivists accountable to users and to each other
 - privileges equitable access and accessibility 

### 2. Users are the fundamental reason for archival description. 

Archivists make descriptive choices that impact how users find, identify, select, and use archival records. To make wise choices about descriptive practices, archivists must develop and maintain an awareness of user needs and behaviors.

### 3. Because archival description privileges intellectual content in context, descriptive rules apply equally to all records, regardless of format or carrier type. 

Descriptive standards must recognize that not all cultures and communities document in the same ways, and our descriptive standards must be flexible enough to accommodate all the ways that human experience is recorded.

Archivists must adapt and respond to changing recordkeeping practices and technologies. Applying a common set of descriptive rules allows archivists to create consistent descriptions. It encourages confidence in professional judgment and gives archivists the flexibility to apply standards judiciously and thoughtfully.

Consistent description across formats: 
 - supports broad description and access 
 - lowers cognitive load for users
 - maintains records’ contexts as well as intellectual content 

### 4. Records, agents, activities, and the relationships between them are the four fundamental concepts that constitute archival description.

Meaning in archival records is revealed through their contexts as much as through their contents. Archivists expose contextual significance by describing records, agents, activities, and the relationships between them. 

 - **Records must be described in aggregate and may be described in parts.**

The whole gives meaning and coherence to the parts. Description of the aggregate is therefore an indispensable component of establishing context and must be provided before proceeding with the description of component parts. Archival description must be appropriate, relevant, and specific to a particular aggregation of records.

 - **Record creators and other agents must be described sufficiently to understand the meaning of records.**

Agents act on records or interact with other agents across time. Agents may be human or machine. 

A category of agents, those responsible for the creation, compilation, and maintenance of the records is particularly important and must be described. Describing these agents requires archivists to document agents’ roles, functions, occupations, and activities.

Archivists must be transparent about the sources of their description and recognize that agents have the right to define their identities, which may change over time.

 - **Activities that are essential to understanding records must be described.**

Activities, whether biographical, historical, or administrative, provide important contextual information. Describing biographical and historical activities adds information that may be absent from the records themselves. Describing administrative activities helps users understand how the records were affected over time by the actions of various agents following their creation. 

 - **The relationships among records, agents, and activities are essential to understanding archives and must be described.**

Relationships, which connect agents, records, and activities, convey meaning that may not be apparent from the contents of records alone. Relationships may be simple or may comprise a complex network of interactions among multiple records, agents, and activities.

### 5. Archival description must be clear about what archivists know, what they don’t know, and how they know it.

Archivists must always provide honest description that mitigates human bias and limitations through open reference to their sources of knowledge. Citation in archival description builds a culture of accountability and trust. 

Honest description:
 - acknowledges archivists’ expertise in records, recordkeeping systems, and documentary forms
 - delineates the limitations of archivists’ knowledge and authority
 - acknowledges that archivists are people, and people are biased

### 6. Archivists must document and make discoverable the actions they take on records.

Archivists and archival repositories are agents whose actions affect records and the ways that all users can access and interact with those records. 

Archivists have an obligation based in professional values of accountability and responsible custody to thoroughly and transparently describe their own interventions in the course of their work. These interventions may potentially affect users’ understandings of records and are an essential part of archival description. 

### 7. Archival description is accessible.

Users of archives encounter barriers to accessing archival description. Typical barriers may be physical, technological, linguistic or geographic. Archivists must limit or remove these barriers to finding and interacting with description.

Accessible archival description engages creators and communities being documented to reflect their complexity, nuance, and fluidity. Archivists must be respectful of the knowledge they hold in trust and the norms of the communities from which they collect, particularly when collecting from communities that have been historically marginalized. 

Accessible and respectful description builds trust between archives, users of archives, and those being documented.

### 8. Archival description should be easy to use, re-use, and share.

Archival description is a form of data, consisting of discrete data elements that can be expressed in a variety of useful outputs.

Users are best able to use, re-use, and share archival description when:
 - it is discoverable
 - it is structured
 - it is machine-readable
 - it is machine-actionable
 - it is available under an open license

Archivists must understand the ways that their data can be consumed by a broad range of users, including people and machines.

### 9. Each collection within a repository must have an archival description.

The absence of archival description is a barrier to users and good stewardship. In order to access archival collections, users must know which collections a repository holds. No matter how basic a description may be, it is more advantageous to users than no description at all. 

Creating these archival descriptions helps archivists meet stewardship needs. This results in:
 - access to a better, broader sense of the scope of our holdings
 - the ability for archivists to gather information about how collections are used
 - guidance for future appraisal and acquisition choices

Archival repositories must deploy their resources in a way that permits them to describe all of their collections as part of their normal business operations.

### 10. Archivists must have a user-driven reason to enhance existing archival description. 

When deciding how comprehensively to describe a collection, the goal should be to maximize the availability of all collection materials to users.

Once all collections in a repository have been described at a minimum level,<sup>[9](#myfootnote9)</sup> archivists may choose to add more description. This choice must be based on demonstrated user needs or the mission of the repository. 

### 11.  Archival description is a continuous intellectual endeavor. 

Description must be iterative. It continually reflects deeper understandings of agents, records, activities, and the relationships between them. It is responsive to users. It is flexible, reflecting changes in knowledge, practice, and values.

# Overview of Archival Description

The principal objective of archival description is the creation of access tools that assist users in discovering desired records. The nature of archival materials, their distribution across many institutions, and the physical requirements of archival repositories necessitate the creation of these descriptive surrogates, which can then be consulted in lieu of directly browsing through quantities of original documents. The archivist must consult other standards and protocols in addition to DACS to construct a robust system of access. This section describes the roles of those standards and protocols and that of DACS within the larger context of the creation of archival descriptions.

## Access Tools

DACS is a standard that is independent of particular forms of output in given information systems, such as manual and electronic catalogs, databases, and other finding aid formats. However, archivists recognize that these rules do not exist as abstractions but will be implemented in actual systems. In practice, DACS will be used principally with the two most commonly employed forms of access tools, catalogs and inventories, though it may be useful in the construction of guides and calendars as well. Archivists must recognize that the systems in which these descriptions appear have functionality and requirements that extend beyond simply presenting the descriptions of archival materials based on Part I and information about the creators of archival records created according to the rules in Part II.

When descriptive information is managed in a locally developed database or presented as entries in a card catalog or as a typescript inventory, local decisions must be made about database design and presentation or the layout of data on the card or printed inventory. When descriptions are recorded in a standard electronic format—MARC 21, EAD, or both—an archivist will have to master the encoding scheme in which the data is stored electronically. Various publications are instructive in the application of these two standards, while the official documentation for each is available in print and online and is cited in Appendix B.<sup>1</sup>

Beyond the details of their respective encoding protocols, both MARC 21 and EAD require the inclusion of data that supplements the information specified in DACS. MARC 21 includes a series of fields of coded information that assist in machine processing of data, such as the dates of the material. The structure of and permissible values for these codes may be found in the MARC 21 documentation. In EAD, the EAD Header element contains information about the electronic file. Its formulation is described in the _Encoded Archival Description Tag Library_.

## Access Points

Then there is the matter of "access points." While archival description is narrative, and electronic catalogs and databases typically provide full-text searching of every word in the text, information systems often also identify specific terms, codes, concepts, and names for which specialized indexes are created to permit faster and more precise searching. In a manual environment, these terms appear as entry headings on catalog records. A variety of protocols, both standardized and local, determine which of the names and terms in a description become "access points" for searching in this way, as well as the form in which they appear. For example, Element 3.1 of DACS instructs the archivist to include in the scope and content element information about the "subject matter to which the records pertain, such as topics, events, people, and organizations." The natural language terminology used to describe such a topic in the scope and content statement must be subsequently translated into the formal syntax of a subject heading, as specified by a standardized thesaurus like the _Library of Congress Authorities_.<sup>2</sup> For example, a collection might contain information about railroads in Montana. After consulting the Library of Congress subject headings and reviewing the directions in the _Subject Cataloging Manual: Subject Headings_ on the formulation of compound subject terms, the archivist will establish the access point as Railroads—Montana. When embedded in a MARC 21 record, the coding will be

    650 b0 ‡a Railroads ‡z Montana

If this data is placed in an EAD finding aid, the resulting encoding will look like this:

    <controlaccess>
      <subject source="lcsh">Railroads--Montana</subject>
    </controlaccess>

Once rendered in a consistent form and included in electronic indexes or as headings in a card file, such standardized data become a powerful tool for researchers to discover materials related to that topic.

It is a local decision as to which names, terms, and concepts found in a description will be included as formal access points, but repositories should provide them in all types of descriptions. Such indexing becomes increasingly important as archivists make encoded finding aids and digital content available to end users through a variety of repository-based and consortial online resource discovery tools.

Access points fall into six broad categories:

*   Names
*   Places
*   Subjects
*   Documentary forms
*   Occupations
*   Functions

Each category is described below and contains a discussion of the parts of the descriptive record in which the concepts that are rendered as access points may be found. The standard format of such terms can be developed locally but preferably will be taken from standard thesauri such as those in Appendix B.

### Names

The names of persons, families, and organizations that are associated with a body of archival materials, either as the creator or the subject of the records, constitute an important pathway by which researchers discover relevant materials. Names that are rendered as _nominal access points_ can be found in several areas of the descriptive record:

*   Name of Creator(s) Element (2.6)
*   Title Element (2.3)
*   Scope and Content Element (3.1)
*   Administrative/Biographical History Element (2.7)
*   Custodial History Element (5.1)
*   Immediate Source of Acquisition Element (5.2)

At a minimum, an access point should be made for every name included in the Name of Creator(s) Element in a single-level description or at the highest level in a multilevel description. Names found in other descriptive elements may be utilized as access points in accordance with local or consortial practice.

### Places

The names of places and geographic features to which the records pertain may be important to researchers. Geographic place-names that should be considered for use as access points may be found in the following parts of the descriptive record:

*   Name of Creator(s) Element (2.6)
*   Title Element (2.3)
*   Scope and Content Element (3.1)
*   Administrative/Biographical History Element (2.7)

### Topical Subjects

The topical subject matter to which the records pertain is among the most important aspects of the archival materials. Terms suggesting topics that might be employed as access points may be found in the following areas of the descriptive record:

*   Title Element (2.3)
*   Scope and Content Element (3.1)
*   Administrative/Biographical History Element (2.7)

A variety of general and specialized subject thesauri, including the _Library of Congress Authorities,_ may be employed as the source for standardized terminology. The most commonly used of these are listed in Appendix B.

### Documentary Forms

Terms that indicate the documentary form(s) or intellectual characteristics of the records being described (e.g., minutes, diaries, reports, watercolors, or documentaries) provide the user with an indication of the content of the materials based on an understanding of the common properties of particular document types. For example, one can deduce the contents of ledgers because they are a standard form of accounting record, one that typically contains certain types of data. Documentary forms are most often noted in the following areas of the descriptive record:

*   Title Element (2.3)
*   Extent Element (2.5)
*   Scope and Content Element (3.1)

The _Art & Architecture Thesaurus_, the _Library of Congress Authorities_, or appropriate media-specific thesauri should be the first sources consulted for terms denoting documentary forms and literary genres.

### Occupations

The occupations, avocations, or other life interests of individuals that are documented in a body of archival material may be of significance to users. Such information is most often mentioned in the following areas of the descriptive record:

*   Scope and Content Element (3.1)
*   Administrative/Biographical History Element (2.7)

Again, the _Library of Congress Authorities_ is a widely used source of terms noting occupations and avocations. The U.S. Department of Labor's _Dictionary of Occupational Titles_ provides a structured enumeration of job titles.

### Functions and Activities

Terms indicating the function(s), activity(ies), transaction(s), and process(es) that generated the material being described help to define the context in which records were created. Examples of such concepts might be the regulation of hunting and fishing or the conservation of natural resources. Functions and activities are often noted in these areas of the descriptive record:

*   Title Element (2.3)
*   Scope and Content Element (3.1)
*   Administrative/Biographical History Element (2.7)

The _Art & Architecture Thesaurus_ contains a hierarchy of terms denoting functions. The _Library of Congress Authorities_ also may be employed.

# Introduction to Describing Archival Materials

## Purpose and Scope

Part I of DACS contains rules to ensure the creation of consistent,
appropriate, and self-explanatory descriptions of archival material. The
rules may be used for describing archival and manuscript materials at
all levels of description, regardless of form or medium. They may also
be applied to the description of intentionally assembled collections and
to discrete items.

While the rules apply to all levels of description and forms of
material, some repositories may wish to describe particular media at
item level or at a level even more detailed than the item, such as
sequence, shot, and so on. These rules do not govern such detailed
levels of description because of the varying nature of institutional
requirements in this area. Incorporating all possible rules for various
types of media would result in a very large volume that would require
regular monitoring of a number of specialized standards and frequent
revisions of DACS as other standards changed. Appendix B offers more
detailed guidance in its lists of specialized standards for various
types of material.

## Data Elements Are Mutually Exclusive

The purpose and scope of each element has been defined so that the
prescribed information can go in one place only. In some cases there are
separate elements for closely related but distinct information, such as
the several elements relating to conditions of access and use. The
stated exclusions for each element indicate which other element can be
used to provide the related information.

## Order of Elements

Archival description is an iterative process that may suggest a certain
sequence or order of elements in a given repository or output system.
However, neither the arrangement of these rules nor their content
mandate a given order. Archivists should be aware that some output
systems may enforce a particular order of elements, and institutional or
consortial guidelines may recommend or even require a given order.

## Sources of Information

All the information to be included in archival descriptions must come
from an appropriate source, the most common of which is the materials
themselves. In contrast to library practice, archivists rarely
transcribe descriptive information directly from archival materials;
rather, they summarize or interpolate information that appears in the
materials or devise information from appropriate external sources, which
can include transfer documents and other acquisition records, file
plans, and reference works. Each element has one or more prescribed
sources of information.

## Options and Alternatives

Some rules are designated as optional; others are designated as
alternative rules.

-   Where a rule represents an instruction that may or may not be used, it is introduced by the word *optionally*. A repository may use     it or not as a matter of institutional policy or on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the archivist.

-   Where a rule represents an alternative equal in status and value to another rule, it is introduced by the word *alternatively*. A
    repository must use one or other as a matter of institutional policy or on a case-by-case basis.

These provisions arise from the recognition that different solutions to
a problem and differing levels of detail and specificity are appropriate
in different contexts. The use of some alternatives and options may be
decided as a matter of description policy at the institutional level to
be exercised either always or never. Other alternatives and options can
be exercised on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the archivist.
Institutions are encouraged to distinguish between these two situations
and to keep a record of their policy decisions and of the circumstances
in which a particular option may be applied.

## Professional Judgment and Institutional Practice

The rules recognize the necessity for judgment and interpretation on the
part of both the person who prepares the description and the institution
responsible for it. Such judgment and interpretation may be based on the
requirements of a particular description, on the use of the material
being described, or on the descriptive system being used. The rules
highlight selected, though certainly not all, points where the need for
professional judgment is called for, using phrases such as “if
appropriate,”“if important*,*” and “if necessary.” While in no way
contradicting the value of standardization, such words and phrases
recognize that uniform rules for all types of descriptions are neither
possible nor desirable, and they encourage institutions to develop and
document a description policy based on specific local knowledge and
consistent application of professional judgment. Furthermore, it is
recognized that a particular data element may be formulated differently
depending on the intended output system. For example, a scope and
content note may be much more extensive in a multilevel finding aid than
in a catalog record.

In addition, institutions may differ in the use of conventions regarding
punctuation, abbreviations, acronyms, and so on. DACS does not prescribe
standards for such usages. However, these general principles should be
followed:

-   Internal consistency should be maintained.

-   Square brackets, as prescribed by cataloging convention to indicate information supplied from other sources, are not required in    archival description.

    -   Abbreviations are discouraged.

    -   Acronyms should be spelled out completely at least once in the text of any descriptive document.

## Descriptive Outputs

The application of these rules will result in descriptions of various
kinds, and the rules do not prescribe any particular output. It is up to
the repository to determine what descriptive products will be produced
and how they will be presented to the end user. Elements can be combined
in a variety of ways, such as through use of punctuation, layout, and
typography, labels, and so on. It is essential for the archivist to
understand the particular output system being used. For example, a
system may automatically display hierarchies and create links between
different levels of description or create links between a unit of
description and other information, such as appraisal or scheduling
information, in such a way that a textual explanation of the
relationship(s) is not necessary. Archivists should keep in mind,
however, that standardization of the presentation or display of archival
descriptive information greatly enhances recognition and understanding
by end users.

## Examples

The examples in Part I are illustrative, not prescriptive. They
illustrate only the application of the rule to which they are appended.
Furthermore, the presentation of the examples is intended only to assist
in understanding how to use the rules and does not imply a prescribed
layout, typography, or output. Some examples include citations for the
body of archival materials from which they were drawn to help clarify
the application of the rule to a particular level of description.

### Chapter 1 

# Levels of Description

Archival material can be described at many different levels.

A finding aid may consist of only one level of description (single-level descriptions), or it may include many different levels of description (multilevel descriptions). A finding aid that consists of multiple levels of description may provide information at successively narrower levels of arrangement (such as subseries, files, and even items) for some series while confining information to a single level of hierarchy for others.<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>

DACS does not attempt to define the proper level of description for any set of archival materials. Archivists should follow the prescriptions of their institutions and apply their own judgment in making such determinations.

DACS defines twenty-five elements that are useful in creating systems for describing archival materials. These systems can be of any type, ranging from simple paper-based files to complex digital information management systems. The output products of these systems—archival descriptions of all kinds and formats, printed on paper or encoded in EAD or MARC 21—must include at minimum a set of discrete descriptive elements that convey standardized information about the archival materials and creators being described. These DACS elements constitute a refinement of the twenty-six high-level elements of archival description defined in the General International Standard Archival Description (ISAD[G]).

Not all of the DACS elements are required in every archival description. Combinations of descriptive elements will vary, depending on whether the archivist considers a specific description to be preliminary or complete and whether it describes archival materials at a single level (e.g., collection level or item level) or at multiple levels that have a whole-part relationship.

Simple archival descriptive systems can be constructed using only the twenty-five elements articulated and defined by this standard; however, more detailed archival descriptive and management systems may require a number of additional elements, either defined by companion standards or standardized at the local level to meet the requirements of a specific repository.

The following requirements specify particular elements from Part I of DACS that should be used in output products—from basic collection-level accession records to fully encoded, multilevel finding aids—intended for the use of archivists or researchers in managing and using archival materials. They articulate a "minimum," "optimum," and "added value" usage of the elements defined by DACS but are not intended to preclude use of other descriptive data that a repository deems necessary for its own descriptive systems or products. DACS does not specify the order or arrangement of elements in a particular descriptive output. Some systems or output formats, such as MARC 21 or EAD, provide specific guidance on the ordering of some or all elements. Others, such as a repository's preliminary accession record or a print finding aid, should include DACS elements in a logical and consistent manner determined by the repository's own procedures and standard practices. The requirements that follow are divided into two sections, one for single-level descriptions and one for multilevel descriptions.

## Requirements for Single-level Descriptions

Following are examples of single-level descriptions:

*   A preliminary accession record
*   A MARC 21 record not linked to other MARC 21 records
*   A database record in a repository's collections management database that describes archival materials only at a single level
*   A METS (Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard)<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup> record for a description of archival materials

Single-level descriptions can describe archival materials at _any level_, from large accumulations commonly referred to by archivists as collections, record groups, fonds, or record series, to single items and any level in between. They can, however, only describe that material at one level.

### Single-level Required

A single-level description with the minimum number of DACS elements includes:

*   Reference Code Element (2.1)
*   Name and Location of Repository Element (2.2)
*   Title Element (2.3)
*   Date Element (2.4)
*   Extent Element (2.5)
*   Name of Creator(s) Element (2.6) _(if known)_
*   Scope and Content Element (3.1)
*   Conditions Governing Access Element (4.1)
*   Languages and Scripts of the Material Element (4.5)

### Single-level Optimum

A single-level description with the optimum number of DACS elements has all of the elements included in Single-level Minimum above, plus the following:

*   Administrative/Biographical History Element (2.7)
*   Access points (See Overview of Archival Description)

### Single-level Added Value

A single-level description using DACS elements to provide added value for researchers includes all of the elements in Single-level Optimum above, plus any other relevant elements the repository wishes to include.

## Requirements for Multilevel Descriptions

Following are examples of multilevel descriptions:

*   A preliminary collection inventory or register (regardless of whether presented in print or encoded in EAD or another encoding scheme)
*   A full collection inventory or register (regardless of whether presented in print or encoded in EAD or another encoding scheme)
*   Multiple linked MARC 21 records
*   A database record in a repository's collections management database that describes archival materials at more than one level

Multilevel descriptions can describe archival materials beginning at any level (e.g., collection level, series level) and must include at least one sublevel. Typical multilevel descriptions begin with large accumulations commonly referred to by archivists as collections, record groups, fonds, or record series. ISAD(G) envisions a descriptive framework that recognizes four levels: fonds, series, file, and item; however, DACS elements can be used to describe materials arranged according to this or any other scheme of articulating levels of arrangement of archival materials.

Within systems that communicate archival description to users, it is often the case that descriptive elements may be shared, inherited, or otherwise linked across and between entities. Traditionally, inheritance has been implicitly presented as hierarchy within the idiom of the print finding aid where frontmatter (collection-level descriptive notes, creator elements, conditions governing access and use, repository information, etc.) applies to archival descriptions on subsequent pages. However, in modern networked archival information systems (relational databases, linked data systems, etc.) linkages, relationships, and inheritances can be non-hierarchical. This makes it particularly important for outputs from these systems to clearly explain relationships so that a user understands which records, agents, or activities an archival description governs.

When a multilevel description is created, the information provided at each descriptive aggregate must be relevant to the material being described within that group.<sup>[3](#myfootnote3)</sup> For instance, archivists should provide administrative and biographical information appropriate and specific to the records being described within that aggregation. Information that is common to component parts should be provided where most generally appropriate and should not be repeated within component parts unless doing so would provide clarity. 

### Multilevel Required

The _top_ level of a multilevel description with the minimum number of DACS elements includes:

*   Reference Code Element (2.1)
*   Name and Location of Repository Element (2.2)
*   Title Element (2.3)
*   Date Element (2.4)
*   Extent Element (2.5)
*   Name of Creator(s) Element (2.6) _(if known)_
*   Scope and Content Element (3.1)
    _Note: In a minimum description, this element may simply provide a short abstract of the scope and content of the materials being described._
*   Conditions Governing Access Element (4.1)
*   Languages and Scripts of the Material Element (4.5)
*   Identification of the whole-part relationship of the _top_ level to at least the _next subsequent_ level in the multilevel description. This may be done through internal tracking within a particular descriptive system; if so, the output must be able to explicitly identify this relationship.

Each _subsequent_ level of a multilevel description should include:

*   All of the elements used at higher levels, unless the information is the same as that of a higher level or if it is desirable to provide more specific information.

_Notes:_

*   Name of Creator(s) Element (2.6): _At subsequent levels of a multilevel description, this element is required only if the person(s) or organization(s) responsible for the creation or accumulation of the material at the subsequent level differs from the higher level(s). This can also be accomplished by using the Name Segment of the Title Element (2.3)._
*   Scope and Content Element (3.1): _Scope and contents are typically necessary for large units of aggregation and are not required at the file or item level if the Title Element (2.3) is sufficient to describe the material._

*   Identification of the whole-part relationship of _each_ level to at least the _next subsequent_ level in the multilevel description. This may be done through internal tracking within a particular descriptive system or through an explicit statement of the relationship.

### Multilevel Optimum

The _top_ level of a multilevel description with the optimum number of DACS elements includes all of the elements in Multilevel Minimum above, plus the following:

*   Administrative/Biographical History Element (2.7)
*   Scope and Content Element (3.1)
    _Note: In an optimum description, this element should include a full description of the scope and content of the materials being described._
*   Access points (See Overview of Archival Description.)

Each _subsequent_ level of that multilevel description should include:

*   All of the elements included at the higher levels of the multilevel description, unless the information is the same as that of a higher level or if it is desirable to provide more specific information.
*   Identification of the whole-part relationship of _each_ level to at least the _next subsequent_ level in the multilevel description. This may be done through internal tracking within a particular descriptive system or through an explicit statement of the relationship.

### Multilevel Added Value

A multilevel description using DACS elements to provide added value for researchers should include all of the elements in Multilevel Optimum above, plus any other elements the repository wishes to include.

Each _subsequent_ level of that multilevel description should include:

*   All of the elements included at the higher levels of the multilevel description, unless the information is the same as that of a higher level or it is desirable to provide more specific information.
*   Identification of the whole-part relationship of _each_ level to at least the _next subsequent_ level in the multilevel description. This may be done thorugh internal tracking within a particular descriptive system or through an explicit statement of the relationship.

# 2.1 Reference Code (Required)

## Purpose and Scope

This element provides a unique identifier for the unit being described. The identifier may consist of three subelements: a local identifier, a code for the repository, and a code for the country.

Commentary: This typically alphanumeric identifier frequently serves as a succinct local means of referring to the materials. When delivering a descriptive record outside of the repository holding the materials, this element should also contain a nationally sanctioned code for the repository and an internationally standardized code for the country in which the repository is located. Taken together, these three subelements form a unique machine-readable identifier for the materials being described.

*   The local identifier code is a means of gaining access to the description of the materials or to the documents themselves. Determining the structure and function(s) of a local identifier code are matters of institutional policy. Examples of local identifiers include accession numbers, record group numbers, and call numbers.

*   The repository identifier code is required only for purposes of consortial, national, or international exchange. The full name of the institution is recorded in the Name and Location of Repository Element (2.2).
*   The country identifier code is required only for purposes of consortial, national, or international exchange.

## Sources of Information

**2.1.1** The codes for country and repository are taken from national and international code lists. Repositories should develop a local system that uniquely identifies discrete materials.

[1] The Library of Congress is responsible for assigning repository codes and maintaining the list of assigned codes in the United States. National repository codes are constructed in accordance with the latest version of ISO 15511 (International Standard identifier for libraries and related organizations).

[2] The two-character country code is found in the latest version of ISO 3166-1 (_Codes for the representation of names of countries and their subdivisions_). While EAD requires the use of the ISO 3166-1 standard for names of countries, the MARC 21 standard has not yet adopted this code list. Use the code appropriate to the output system for a given description. The _MARC Code List for Countries_ is used in archival cataloging (e.g., mixed materials) to indicate the country of the repository in the 008 field.



# 2.2 Name and Location of Repository (Required)

## Purpose and Scope

This element identifies the name and location of the repository that holds the materials being described.

Commentary: It may be possible for a system to generate the name of the repository from the repository identifier as specified in Rule 2.1.4.

## Sources of Information

**2.2.1** Take the information from institutional policies and procedures.

## General Rules

**2.2.2** Explicitly state the name of the repository, including any parent bodies.

<p class="dacs-example">The University of Texas at Austin, Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center</p>

<p class="dacs-example">The Minnesota Historical Society</p>

**2.2.3** Provide the location of the repository. If desirable, include the mailing address and other contact information.

<p class="dacs-example">Alabama Department of Archives and History. 624 Washington Avenue, Montgomery, AL 36130-0100. (334) 242-4435.</p>
# 2.3 Title (Required)

## Purpose and Scope

This element provides a word or phrase by which the material being described is known or can be identified. A title may be devised or formal.

Commentary: A _devised title_ is one provided by the archivist when there is no formal title for the materials being described or when the formal title is misleading or inadequate. The rules for recording a devised title differ from the rules for recording a formal title. Archivists usually devise titles for archival materials.

Devised titles generally have two parts:

*   the name of the creator(s) or collector(s)
*   the nature of the materials being described

A _formal title_ is one that appears prominently on or in the materials being described and is most commonly found in material that has been published or distributed, such as a title on a book, report, map, or film. Formal titles can also be found on unpublished material that bears a meaningful name consciously given by the creator of the material, (e.g., a caption on a photograph, label on a folder, or leader on a film).

In the absence of a meaningful formal title, a title must be devised. The archivist must use professional judgment to determine when it is appropriate to devise a title rather than transcribe a label on a container that may be misleading. When they occur at all in archival materials, formal titles are most commonly found on files or items.

## Sources of Information

**2.3.1** When devising a title, take the information from any reliable source, including the internal evidence of the materials being described, an external source such as a records schedule or communication with a donor, or a title on another copy or version of the materials being described.

**2.3.2** When recording a formal title, transcribe the information according to the appropriate standard. Some companion standards are suggested in Appendix B. Rules for transcribing formal titles are not provided here.

## General Rules

**2.3.3** When devising title information, compose a brief title<sup>1</sup> that uniquely identifies the material, normally consisting of a name segment, a term indicating the nature of the unit being described,<sup>2</sup> and optionally a topical segment as instructed in the following rules. Do not enclose devised titles in square brackets.

Commentary:

*   In multilevel descriptions the name segment may be inherited from a higher level of description and may not need to be explicitly stated at lower levels.
*   When the repository is responsible for assembling a collection, provide, as part of the devised title, the institution's name as the collector.
*   The topical segment should be used only when the identification of the material cannot be made clear from the name and nature elements.

## Name Segment

**2.3.4** Record the name(s) of the person(s), family (families), or corporate body<sup>3</sup> predominantly responsible for the creation, assembly, accumulation, and/or maintenance of the materials.

<p class="dacs-example">Graciany Miranda Archilla</p>
<p class="dacs-example">Bacot family</p>
<p class="dacs-example">Bank of Cape Fear (Wilmington, N.C.) Hillsboro Branch</p>
<p class="dacs-example">Wisconsin Environmental Policy Act</p>
<p class="dacs-example">Cameron family</p>
<p class="dacs-example">Caroline and Erwin Swann</p>
<p class="dacs-example">University of California, Santa Barbara Office of Public Information</p>
<p class="dacs-example">Oregon Dept. of Fish and Wildlife Northeast Region</p>

**2.3.5** Record the name(s) in the form by which the creator or collector is generally known.<sup>4</sup> Record the name(s) in the natural language order of the language of the person's or corporate body's country of residence or activity or the official language of the corporate body. The name may be abbreviated if a fuller form of the name appears elsewhere in the descriptive record (e.g., in the administrative/biographical history) or as an access point.

<p class="dacs-example">Bessye J. Bearden</p>
<p class="dacs-example"><em>as opposed to the controlled form,</em> "Bearden, Bessye J."</p>
<p class="dacs-example">WAPOR</p>
<p class="dacs-example"><em>The controlled form</em> World Association for Public Opinion Research <em>appears in the Name of Creator(s) Element.</em></p>

**2.3.6** If the name of the creator, assembler, or collector is not known, do not record a name. In such cases, devise the nature of the archival materials for the title as instructed in rules 2.3.18–2.3.20 and 2.3.22.

<p class="dacs-example">Collection of San Francisco Graft Prosecution Records</p>
<p class="dacs-example">Performing Arts publications collection</p>

### Name Segment for More Than One Person

**2.3.7** If three or fewer persons are credited with, or predominantly responsible for, the creation of the materials as a whole, record their names in direct order. The person who was responsible for the creation of the greatest part of the materials should be listed first. If no such determination can be made, the names should be listed in alphabetical order.

<p class="dacs-example">John and Leni Sinclair papers</p>
<p class="dacs-example">Eugenia Rawls and Donald Seawell theater collection</p>

**2.3.8** If responsibility for the creation of the materials is dispersed among more than three persons, record the name of the individual whose material predominates. If this does not apply, choose the name considered most appropriate.

**2.3.9** Optionally, include all the names of the persons who are credited with or predominantly responsible for the creation of the materials.

### Name Segment for Families

**2.3.10** If the materials were created, assembled, accumulated, and/or used in the context of familial relations by individuals who share a common surname, record that name followed by the word _family_.

<p class="dacs-example">Harvey family papers</p>
<p class="dacs-example">Grieg family photographs</p>

**2.3.11** If the materials were created, assembled, accumulated, and/or used in the context of familial relations by individuals who do not share a common surname, record all their names followed by the word _family_.

<p class="dacs-example">Paul Hibbet Clyde and Mary Kestler family papers</p>

**2.3.12** Optionally, if the materials were created, assembled, accumulated, and/or used in the context of familial relations but one person's material predominates, record that person's full name followed by the word _family_.

<p class="dacs-example">Andrew Swanson family papers</p>

**2.3.13** If two or three families are credited with, or predominantly responsible for, the creation of the materials, record all the family names followed by the word _families_.

<p class="dacs-example">Short, Harrison, and Symmes families papers</p>

**2.3.14** If responsibility for the creation of the materials is dispersed among more than three families, record only the name of the family whose material predominates. If no one family's material predominates, choose the name considered most appropriate.

<p class="dacs-example">Young family papers</p>

<p class="dacs-example"><em>Collection material predominantly from the Young family of Paw Paw, Michigan, but also relates to Butler, Carpenter, Comstock, and Goodrich families. Example from the Department of Special Collections, Davidson Library, University of California, Santa Barbara.</em></p>

**2.3.15** Optionally,include all the names of the families who are credited with, or predominantly responsible for, the creation of the materials.

<p class="dacs-example">Clement, Balinger, Logan, and Stiles family papers</p>
<p class="dacs-example"><em>Collection title from the Camden County Historical Society.</em></p>

### Name Segment for Corporate Bodies

**Single corporate body** see Rule 2.3.4.

**More than one corporate body**

**2.3.16** If the records of more than one corporate body are included in the materials, record only one name in the title. Establish a consistent policy for selecting the name of the corporate body to be used in the title. While the name of only one corporate body can be included in the title, names of other corporate bodies whose records are included in the materials may be recorded in the Name of Creator(s) Element as specified in Rule 2.6.7.

<p class="dacs-example">British American Tobacco Company records</p>
<p class="dacs-example"><em>This body of corporate records includes records of</em> Cameron and Cameron, D. B. Tennant and Company, David Dunlop, Export Leaf Tobacco Company, and T. C. Williams Company, <em>all of which were tobacco exporting companies acquired by British American Tobacco Company</em>.</p>

**Corporate body whose name has changed**

**2.3.17** Where the name of the corporate body has changed, use the last (latest) name of the corporate body represented in the materials being described. Predecessor names of the corporate body may be recorded in the Name of Creator(s) Element as specified in Rule 2.6.7.

<p class="dacs-example">University of California, Irvine, Office of Research and Graduate Studies records</p>
<p class="dacs-example"><em>These records include those from this same body under two previous names,</em> Graduate Division (1964–1981) <em>and</em> Division of Graduate Studies and Research(1981–1987).</p>

<p class="dacs-example">Allied Theatres of Michigan records</p>
<p class="dacs-example"><em>These materials include records of this same body under its earlier name,</em> Motion Picture Theatre Owners of Michigan <em>(name changed in 1931)</em>.</p>
_

**2.3.18** Optionally, where the name of the corporate body has changed, use the name under which the bulk of the material was created.

## Nature of the Archival Unit

**2.3.19** Archival materials are frequently described by devised aggregate terms such as _papers_ (for personal materials), _records_ (for organizational materials), or _collection_ (for topical aggregations). However, other terms are also used. The term(s) used to describe the nature of archival materials should be comprehensible to the institution's patrons. Titles should be constructed in a coherent and consistent format according to the rules of the individual institution.

<p class="dacs-example">Coalition to Stop Trident records</p>
<p class="dacs-example">St. Paul African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church records</p>
<p class="dacs-example">Mortimer Jerome Adler papers</p>
<p class="dacs-example">Allyn Kellogg Ford collection of historical manuscripts</p>
<p class="dacs-example">Semans family papers</p>

**2.3.20** Where the materials being described consist solely of one or two specific forms, supply those form(s)<sup>5</sup> for the nature of the archival unit. Express the forms in their order of predominance.

<p class="dacs-example">English Stage Company at the Royal Court Theatre correspondence</p>
<p class="dacs-example">John E. Brennan outdoor advertising survey reports</p>
<p class="dacs-example">William Gedney photographs and writings</p>
<p class="dacs-example">Troy Kinney etchings and engravings</p>
<p class="dacs-example">Sarah Dyer zine collection</p>
<p class="dacs-example">Andrew Jackson letter</p>
<p class="dacs-example">John Kenyon Chapman files</p>
<p class="dacs-example">Speeches</p>
<p class="dacs-example"><em>Devised title for a series within the</em> Bessye J. Bearden papers</p>
<p class="dacs-example">Audio and video recordings</p>
<p class="dacs-example"><em>Devised title for a series within the</em> Jacques Derrida papers</p>
<p class="dacs-example">National Academy of Sciences correspondence</p>
<p class="dacs-example"><em>Devised title for a file within the</em> Frederick Reines papers</p>
<p class="dacs-example">Council for Refugee Rights correspondence and reports</p>
<p class="dacs-example"><em>Devised title for a file within the</em> Project Ngoc records</p>

**2.3.21** Optionally, if one or two specific forms predominate but there are also other material types present, record the one or two most predominant forms followed by the phrase "and other material" in the devised title and indicate the specific forms of material in the Scope and Content Element.

<p class="dacs-example">James M. Woodbury diary, letters, and other material</p>
<p class="dacs-example">Sociedad Amigos de Arteaga, Inc., correspondence, flyers, and other material</p>
<p class="dacs-example"><em>Devised title for a file within the</em> Genoveva de Arteaga papers</p>

### Topic of the Archival Unit

**2.3.22** Optionally, devise a brief term or phrase that most precisely and concisely characterizes the unit being described. The term or phrase should incorporate the form(s) of material that typifies the unit and reflects the function, activity, transaction, subject, individuals, or organizations that were the basis of its creation or use.

<p class="dacs-example">Clarence McGehee collection on Ruth St. Denis</p>
<p class="dacs-example">Catherine Clarke civil rights collection</p>
<p class="dacs-example">Collection of California vacation albums</p>
<p class="dacs-example"><em>Devised title for a collection of purchased vacation albums assembled by Special Collections and Archives, University of California, Irvine</em></p>
<p class="dacs-example">Russian referendum collection</p>
<p class="dacs-example"><em>Devised title for a collection of materials on the 1993 Russian referendum in support of the policies of Boris Yeltsin that was assembled by Manuscripts and Archives, Yale University</em></p>
<p class="dacs-example">Land agreements between the University of California and the Irvine Company</p>
<p class="dacs-example">Edith Wharton correspondence with Morton Fullerton</p>
<p class="dacs-example">Oneida Nation petition to Jasper Parrish</p>
<p class="dacs-example">Frank and Frances Robinson files on Upper Newport Bay</p>
<p class="dacs-example">Correspondence regarding graduate assistantships</p>
<p class="dacs-example">James Joyce letter to Maurice Saillet</p>
<p class="dacs-example">Richard Nixon letter to H. R. Haldeman regarding the Watergate break-in</p>

**2.3.23** When the subject of the collection is a person, and if no name has been recorded because the repository is the collector, express the title of the collection in a way that clearly indicates that the subject of the collection is not the collector.

<p class="dacs-example">Collection on Isadora Duncan</p>
<p class="dacs-example"><em>The collection is about Isadora Duncan; she is not the collector.</em></p>

<p class="dacs-example">Collection of Robert Browning materials</p>
<p class="dacs-example"><em>The collection comprises materials by Robert Browning; he is not the collector.</em></p>

* * *

[1] The devised title should not be mistaken for a statement or abstract of the content of the unit being described; the devised title simply names the unit as succinctly as possible. The contents of the unit, e.g., that of an individual letter, should be described in the Scope and Content Element.

[2] The order of these elements is not prescribed.

[3] The name of more than one person or family can appear in the title; however, the name of only one corporate body can appear in the title.

[4] Guidance for choosing between different names of persons (including name changes) or between variant forms of the same name can be found in Chapter 12 (rules 12.1–12.3). Guidance for choosing between different names of corporate bodies or between variant forms of the same name can be found in Chapter 14 (rules 14.1–14.3).

[5] _Form_ means the physical (e.g., watercolor, drawing) or intellectual (e.g., diary, journal, daybook, minute book) characteristics of a document. Repositories are strongly encouraged to use standardized vocabulary when describing form(s) of material as part of the devised title.
# 2.4 Date (Required)

## Purpose and Scope

This element identifies and records the date(s) that pertain to the creation, assembly, accumulation, and/or maintenance and use of the materials being described. This element describes types of dates and forms of dates.

Commentary: It may be useful or necessary for archivists to record different types of dates for the materials being described, including:

**Date(s) of creation** are the dates that the documents in the unit being described were originally created (e.g., date of writing a letter, drawing a map, or painting a portrait) or the date that an event or image was captured in some material form (e.g., date that a photograph was taken, sound was originally recorded, or a film was shot). Dates of creation refer only to the activity of creation of individual documents that make up each unit (as opposed to the "creation" of an aggregate such as a series or file). This is the type of date recorded most often by archivists and manuscript catalogers not describing government or organizational records.

**Date(s) of record-keeping activity** are the dates during which the unit being described was created, assembled, accumulated, and/or maintained and used _as a unit_ in the conduct of affairs by the organization or individual responsible for its provenance. They are distinct from the dates of creation of individual documents. Although the dates of record-keeping activity may often coincide with the dates of creation, the date types differ in two ways. First, the date(s) of record-keeping activity refer to the dates of a number of interrelated activities (including, but not limited to, creation and accumulation); and second, the activities pertain to the unit as a whole as opposed to individual documents. Records may be accumulated and used for a current purpose long after they were originally created, for example, where much earlier records are assembled to support an investigation or a legal action.

When dates of creation and dates of record-keeping activity are the same, record only the former. Dates of record-keeping activity are most often recorded by archivists working with government records, organizational archives, or other materials where it is important to account for functions and activities.

**Date(s) of publication** are recorded if the unit being described is a commercially issued or mass-produced item. Record this date information (including dates of publishing, distributing, releasing, and issuing of items) according to rules in various chapters of _RDA_ or other appropriate standards (see Appendix B). Dates of publication are most often recorded when describing items.

**Date(s) of broadcast** are dates on which sound recordings or moving image materials were broadcast on radio or television. Record this date information according to rules in various chapters of _RDA_ or other appropriate standards (see Appendix B). Dates of broadcast are most often recorded when describing items.

## Exclusions

**2.4.1** If the material being described is a reproduction, record the details about the reproduction, including the date(s) of reproduction, if known, in the Scope and Content Element (Rule 3.1.7). If the material being described is the original and the repository wishes to provide details about the availability of copies, record that information in the Existence and Location of Copies Element (6.2).

## Sources of Information

**2.4.2** Take the information from any reliable source, including the internal evidence of the materials being described.

## General Rules

**2.4.3** Record dates of creation, record-keeping activity, publication, or broadcast as appropriate to the materials being described.

**2.4.4** Alternatively, if relevant and deemed necessary by the repository and if the descriptive system permits it, record multiple types of dates, labeling each clearly.<sup>1</sup> When recording multiple date types, explain each in the Scope and Content Element (3.1).

**2.4.5** Record the year(s) in Western-style Arabic numerals. If the date found in or on the unit being described is not of the Gregorian or Julian calendar, record the date as found in a note, specifying the name of the calendar, such as Republican, Jewish, Chinese, in a note (see Rule 7.1.2).

<p class="dacs-example">1968</p>
<p class="dacs-example"><em>Note: Date on item is 2628, which is dated in accordance with the Chinese calendar.</em></p>
<p class="dacs-example">1805</p>
<p class="dacs-example"><em>Note: Date on item is an 14, which is dated in accordance with the French Republican calendar.</em></p>
**2.4.6** Record the date(s) of the unit being described either as a range, series, or a single date.

<p class="dacs-example">1801,1929</p>
<p class="dacs-example">1980-2001</p>
<p class="dacs-example">1776</p>
## Date Ranges

### Inclusive Dates

**2.4.7** If the materials in the unit or the record-keeping activity relating to the unit being described span a period of time, always record the inclusive dates, that is, the earliest and latest dates of the materials or activity in question.

<p class="dacs-example">1849-1851</p>
**2.4.8** When further accruals are expected, record the inclusive dates pertaining to the holdings currently in the custody of the repository. Record information about expected accruals in the Accruals Element (5.4). When the accruals are received, revise the date information accordingly.

<p class="dacs-example">1979-1993</p>
<p class="dacs-example"><em>not</em>1979-</p>
<p class="dacs-example"><em>not</em>1979-(ongoing)</p>
**2.4.9** The date(s) of a unit being described must fall within the range of dates of the unit of which it forms a part. This rule applies to both dates of creation and dates of record-keeping activity.

<p class="dacs-example">1934-1985</p>
<p class="dacs-example"><em>Dates of record-keeping activity for a body of corporate records</em></p>
<p class="dacs-example">1945-1960</p>
<p class="dacs-example"><em>Dates of record-keeping activity for a series within the above</em></p>
<p class="dacs-example">1950-1955</p>
<p class="dacs-example"><em>Dates of record-keeping activity for a file within the above</em></p>
### Predominant or Bulk Dates

**2.4.10** Optionally, where the dates pertaining to the majority of the documents in the unit being described differ significantly from the inclusive dates, provide predominant or bulk dates. Specify them as such, preceded by the word _predominant_ or _bulk_. Never provide predominant or bulk dates without also providing inclusive dates.

<p class="dacs-example">1785-1960, bulk 1916-1958</p>
<p class="dacs-example">1942-1998, predominant 1975-1991</p>
**2.4.11** Optionally, if there is a significant gap in the chronological sequence of the documents in the unit being described, where providing predominant/bulk dates would be misleading, record the anomalous date(s) separated by commas.<sup>2</sup> Explain significant chronological gaps in the materials in the Scope and Content Element (3.1).

<p class="dacs-example">1827, 1952-1978</p>
<p class="dacs-example">1975, 2002</p>
### Estimated Date Ranges

**2.4.12** At all levels of description, where the earliest or latest dates pertaining to the unit being described are estimates, indicate the estimated dates in a clear and consistent fashion.<sup>3</sup>

<p class="dacs-example">approximately 1952-1978</p>
<p class="dacs-example">circa 1870-1879</p>
## Single Dates

**2.4.13** If the materials fall within a single year, record that date or a more specific date therein.

<p class="dacs-example">1975</p>
<p class="dacs-example">1975 March-August</p>
### Exact Single Dates

**2.4.14** For descriptions of a single item, record exact dates in a consistent and unambiguous fashion, preferably expressed as year-month-day.<sup>4</sup>

<p class="dacs-example">1906 March 17</p>
### Estimated Single Dates

**2.4.15** If no date can be found on or in the material itself or determined from any other source, estimate the nearest year, decade, century, or other interval as precisely as possible. Record estimated dates in a consistent fashion.

<p class="dacs-example">probably 1867</p>
<p class="dacs-example">approximately 1925</p>
<p class="dacs-example">before 1867</p>
<p class="dacs-example">after 1867 January 5</p>
<p class="dacs-example">1892 or 1893</p>
<p class="dacs-example">1890s</p>
<p class="dacs-example">circa August 1975</p>
## No Dates

**2.4.16** When recording date(s) for files and items, if the unit being described bears no date and the institution does not wish to or it may be misleading to record an estimated date, use _undated_. Do not use the abbreviations "n.d." or "s.d."

* * *

[1] Most MARC-based systems will allow only one date type, and the repository's ability to label dates will be very limited. EAD and other systems are more flexible in this area.

[2] Repositories are encouraged to establish consistent policies and procedures regarding the maximum number of anomalous dates to record.

[3] It is recommended, though not required, that terms reflecting estimation be spelled out rather than abbreviated, as abbreviations may not be understood by all users.

[4] Expression of dates as all numerals is discouraged due to the differing conventions in the order of information.

# 2.5 Extent (Required)

## Purpose and Scope

This element indicates the extent and the physical nature of the materials being described. This is handled in two parts, a number (quantity) and an expression of the extent or material type. The second part of the Extent Element may be either:

*   the physical extent of the materials expressed either as the items, containers or carriers, or storage space occupied; or
*   an enumeration of the material type(s), usually physical material type(s), to which the unit being described belongs. Material types may be general or specific.

Repositories should establish a consistent method of articulating statements of extent.

If the description of particular media or individual items requires more detail, such as other physical characteristics or dimensions, consult an appropriate standard, such as those listed in Appendix B.

If the material type has been provided in the title statement, do not repeat it in the statement of extent.

Commentary: It is important to include information about the quantity and physical nature of the materials for several reasons. It enables users to eliminate material that is irrelevant to their needs; for example, a user may want only the material containing photographs. It also enables users to plan their research: knowing the quantity is important because it takes longer to go through thirty boxes or twenty hours of sound recordings than it does to go through one box or five hours. The amount of detail provided at any level of description is a matter of institutional policy, depending on user needs and available resources. At lower levels in a multilevel description, extent may be expressed as an enumeration of boxes or folders rather than as a narrative extent statement.

Further details about quantity and physical characteristics may also be provided in the Scope and Content Element (3.1).

## Exclusions

**2.5.1** Record information about physical characteristics that affect the use of the unit being described in the Physical Access Element (4.2).

## Sources of Information

**2.5.2** Derive the information from the materials themselves or take it from transfer documents, published descriptions, or other reliable sources.

## General Rules

**2.5.3** Record the numerical quantity associated with each expression of physical extent, containers or carriers, number of items, or material type, using the imperial system of measurement in Arabic numerals, unless the repository has made a decision to use the metric system.

**2.5.4** Record the quantity of the material in terms of its physical extent as linear or cubic feet, number of items, or number of containers or carriers.<sup>1</sup>

<p class="dacs-example">45 linear feet</p>
<p class="dacs-example">5,321 items</p>
<p class="dacs-example">16 boxes</p>
<p class="dacs-example">2 film reels</p>
<p class="dacs-example">15 folders</p>
<p class="dacs-example">10.0 cubic feet</p>
**2.5.5** Optionally, record the quantity in terms of material type(s). Material types may be general, such as textual materials,<sup>2</sup> graphic materials, cartographic materials, architectural and technical drawings, moving images, and sound recordings, or more specific types, such as those found in RDA and various thesauri.<sup>3</sup>

<p class="dacs-example">10 boxes of textual materials</p>
<p class="dacs-example">1,000 photographs</p>
<p class="dacs-example">50 technical drawings</p>
<p class="dacs-example">800 maps</p>
<p class="dacs-example">12 audiocassettes</p>
**2.5.6** Optionally, qualify the statement of physical extent to highlight the existence of material types that are important.

<p class="dacs-example">45 linear feet, including 200 photographs and 16 maps</p>
<p class="dacs-example">3 boxes, including photographs and audiocassettes</p>
## Multiple Statements of Extent

**2.5.7** If a parallel expression of extent is required or desirable, add this information in parentheses.

<p class="dacs-example">2,400 photographs (12 linear feet)</p>
<p class="dacs-example">89.3 linear feet (150 boxes and 109 oversize folders)</p>
<p class="dacs-example">71 maps (3.5 cubic feet)</p>
<p class="dacs-example">1 diary (352 pages)</p>
<p class="dacs-example">52 megabytes (1,180 computer files)</p>
<p class="dacs-example">0.5 linear feet (51 floppy discs, 5 Zip discs, 3 CD-ROMs)</p>

[1] It is recommended, though not required, that terms reflecting physical extent be spelled out rather than abbreviated, as abbreviations may not be understood by all users.

[2] It is usually assumed that archival materials are textual in nature, so it may not be necessary to supply the term "textual materials" unless it is desirable to distinguish from other material types.

# 2.6 Name of Creator(s) (Required, If Known)

## Purpose and Scope

This element identifies the corporate bodies, persons, and families associated with the creation, assembly, accumulation, and/or maintenance and use of the materials being described so that they might be appropriately documented and used to create access points by which users can search for and retrieve descriptive records.

Commentary: For archival materials, the creator is typically the corporate body, person, or family responsible for an entire body of materials. However, a creator can also be responsible for the intellectual or artistic content of a single item, as in the writer of a letter or the painter of a portrait. A collector or compiler of materials (e.g., Vietnam War memorabilia, letters of presidents of the United States, or materials relating to suffragettes) is considered the creator of the collection.

This element provides rules for determining which entities need to be documented as creators. The names selected in this process can also serve as access points—index terms by which users can search for and locate relevant archival materials. The use of the names of creators as access points enables researchers to gain access to an institution's holdings and provides a means of linking all records created by a particular person, family, or corporate body. The selection of access points is discussed in the Overview of Archival Description.

Repositories should standardize the formation of creator names to ensure that the name is identical each time it is used in a descriptive system and that each person, family, or corporate body has a heading that applies to it alone. Repositories are encouraged to employ recognized standardized vocabularies (e.g., _Library of Congress Authorities_) and formulate nominal access points according to established rules, such as those found in AACR2 or RDA.

## Exclusions

**2.6.1** The rules for creating archival authority records are found in Part II.

**2.6.2** Record information about entities that held custody of the materials being described but are not responsible for the creation, assembly, accumulation, and/or maintenance and use of the materials in the Custodial History Element (5.1).

## Sources of Information

**2.6.3** The source for the name of the creator is usually the name element in the devised title (2.3.4–2.3.17). Take the information from any reliable source, including the internal evidence of the materials being described, an external source such as a records schedule or communication with a donor.

Commentary: When describing the records of a person or family for which there are several creators, the devised title may contain all of the creators' names. However, it is much more likely that the repository will choose to include in the title only the name of the person or family around which the collection is formed. Names of other creators can appear in other parts of the description (e.g., the Administrative/Biographical History Element, 2.7) and be recorded as access points. When devising a title for the records of a corporate body, only one creator can be named in the title. Other creators can be mentioned in other parts of the description (e.g., the Administrative/Biographical History Element, 2.7) and recorded as access points. Rules for formulating the name segment of devised titles are found in rules 2.3.4–2.3.17.

## General Rules

**2.6.4** Record the name(s) of the creator(s) identified in the name element in the devised title of the materials using standardized vocabularies (e.g., _Library of Congress Authorities_) or with rules for formulating standardized names, such as those found in AACR2, ISAAR(CPF), or RDA.

# 2.7 Administrative/Biographical History (Optimum)

## Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this element is to describe the required elements of a biographical or administrative history note about creators embedded in the description of materials. The administrative/biographical history provides relevant information about corporate bodies, persons, or families who are identified using the Name of Creator(s) Element and who therefore function as nominal access points. This element also describes the relationship of creators to archival materials by providing information about the context in which those materials were created.

Commentary: Information about the corporate body, person, or family that created, assembled, accumulated, and/or maintained and used the materials being described may be described in one of two ways:

1.  Incorporated into the description using biographical/historical notes. These rules are covered here in Element 2.7.

2.  Held in a separate system of authority files that are linked to the archival descriptions and displayed together. These rules are covered in Part II.

Archivists may wish to devise more or less detail, depending on the system being used and other local variables. For example, the administrative/biographical history information in a catalog record describing the materials should be brief, while an authority record or creator sketch in a multilevel finding aid may be much more extensive, consisting of a narrative description, chronology, or both.

There may be instances in describing collections where providing information about the collector is not necessary—for example, when the repository is the collector.

## Exclusions

**2.7.1** Record information about the scope and content of the materials in the Scope and Content Element (3.1).

**2.7.2** Record information about the structure or arrangement of the materials in the System of Arrangement Element (3.2).

**2.7.3** Record information about the custodial history in the Custodial History Element (5.1).

## Sources of Information

**2.7.4** Assemble the information from reliable sources, such as the materials themselves and reference works. Establish a consistent policy regarding the content, form, and placement of citation of sources and quotations.

## Rules for Biographical Historical Notes Done Within the Description

**2.7.5** Where the administrative/biographical history is provided within the description, provide administrative/biographical history at the highest levels of description as instructed in rules 2.7.6 to 2.7.33.

**2.7.6** At the highest level of description, give information about the history of the corporate body(ies), person(s), or family(ies) that created, assembled, accumulated, and/or maintained and used the material as a whole.

**2.7.7** Optionally, at subsequent levels of description, if the creator of the subordinate unit is different from the creator of the material as a whole, give information about the history of the corporate body(ies), person(s), or family(ies) that created, assembled, accumulated, and/or maintained and used that subordinate unit.

**2.7.8** When primary responsibility for the creation, assembly, accumulation, and/or maintenance and use of the materials is shared between two or more corporate bodies, or two or more persons, or two or more families, create separate administrative/biographical histories for each corporate body, person, or family.

**2.7.9** When primary responsibility for the creation, assembly, accumulation, and/or maintenance and use of the materials is shared between two or more members of a family, create separate biographical histories for the family and for each person.

## Selection of the Subelements

**2.7.10** Include in the Administrative/Biographical History all of the following subelements<sup>1</sup> that are relevant to the corporate body, person, or family being described and that provide the information necessary to explain the context in which the materials were created, assembled, accumulated, and/or maintained and used.

### Biographical History of Individuals or Families

He was educated in the public schools of St. Louis, Missouri, where his family lived during his childhood. He also attended the public schools of Kansas City, Kansas, where his family later moved. Upon graduation in 1916, Boatner took lessons in voice and piano at Western University in Quindaro, Kansas, for a short time. Later that year Boatner sang for the famous tenor Roland Hayes, who encouraged the young baritone to continue his vocal studies in Boston. Boatner followed Hayes's advice and moved to Boston in 1917. In 1925, Boatner moved to Chicago in order to complete his formal education. He earned his bachelor's degree in music from the Chicago College of Music in 1932. During his student years in Chicago, Boatner directed the choirs at Olivet Baptist Church and concertized widely as a singer. His reputation grew during the years 1925-1933, when he was director of music for the National Baptist Convention. In 1933, Boatner was appointed director of music at Samuel Huston College in Austin, Texas. He later taught at the Wiley College in Marshall, Texas, where he was appointed dean of music.

<p class="dacs-example">Unpublished manuscripts are protected by copyright. Permission to publish, quote, or reproduce must be secured from the repository and the copyright holder.</p>

### Copyright Status

Commentary: The statement of copyright status of a work indicates whether or not it is protected by copyright and, if it is protected, the duration and owner of the copyright. The copyright status is determined by the copyright legislation of the country in which the archives preserving the work is located. Where the term of copyright protection has expired, it is useful to indicate that the work may be used freely for any purpose without the permission of the copyright owner or the payment of royalties. Where the work is still subject to copyright protection, it is useful to indicate the duration of copyright protection and the copyright owner, should the user require permission to use the work for purposes other than private study, scholarship, or research. Copyright laws provide the copyright owner with other rights in addition to copying, including the right to control publication, distribution, broadcast, public performance, and so on. Copyright laws may also permit archives and libraries to copy items in their holdings for limited purposes, such as research or preservation, without the permission of the copyright owner, provided that certain conditions are met.

**4.4.7** If the details of the copyright status of the materials being described are unknown, unclear, or complex, make a general statement about possible copyright restrictions.

<p class="dacs-example">Copyright restrictions may apply.</p>

**4.4.8** If the materials being described are protected by copyright, indicate the copyright owner, when the copyright restrictions will expire, and contact information for the copyright owner or the owner's agent, if known.

<p class="dacs-example">To the extent that she owns copyright, the donor has assigned the copyright in her works to the Archives; however, copyright in some items in this collection may be held by their respective creators. Consult the reference archivist for details.</p>

**4.4.9** If the term of copyright has expired, indicate that the material being described is no longer subject to copyright restrictions.

<p class="dacs-example">Material in this collection is in the public domain.</p>

### Conditions Governing Reproduction

Commentary: Reproduction is defined as the making of copies of all or part of an item in the unit being described. It does not involve other uses, such as publication, public viewing, broadcast, and so on. While copyright legislation may place statutory restrictions on reproduction (as well as other uses), reproduction may be restricted for other reasons, such as the wishes of the donor, physical condition, and so on.

**4.4.10** If the conditions governing reproduction are fully expressed in the copyright status statement, do not repeat them in a separate statement.

# 4.5 Languages and Scripts of the Material (Required)

## Purpose and Scope

This element identifies the language(s), script(s), and symbol systems employed in the materials being described, particularly as they may affect its use.

Commentary: While most repositories in the United States will provide descriptions in English, it is frequently the case that some or all of a body of archival material is in other languages.

Language and script information may also be represented as codes for machine processing using the appropriate ISO codes for languages (ISO 639-1 and ISO 639-2: _Codes for the representation of names of languages_) or scripts (ISO 15924: _Codes for the representation of names of scripts_).

# 4.6 Finding Aids (Added Value)

## Purpose and Scope

This element identifies any other finding aids to the materials being described, particularly if they are available to the user, and provides information about the form and content of those finding aids.

Commentary: Finding aid is a broad term that covers any type of description or means of reference made or received by an archival repository in the course of establishing administrative or intellectual control over archival materials. The term "finding aid" can include a variety of descriptive tools prepared by an archives (e.g., guides, calendars, inventories, box lists, indexes, etc.) or prepared by the creator of the records (e.g., registers, indexes, transfer lists, classification schemes, etc.). Such tools provide a representation of, or a means of access to, the materials being described that enables users to identify material relating to the subject of their inquiries. An archival repository's descriptive system will likely consist of various types of finding aids, each serving a particular purpose.

## Sources of Information

**4.6.1** Derive the information from the other finding aids.

## General Rules

**4.6.2** Record information about any existing finding aids that provide information relating to the context and contents of the unit being described. As appropriate and available, include information about the type (e.g., list, index, guide, calendar, etc.), medium (e.g., cards, electronic, etc.), and content (e.g., names of correspondents, subjects, etc.) of the finding aid, the number or other identifier of the finding aid (if any), any relevant information about its location or availability, and any other information necessary to assist the user in evaluating its usefulness. Include finding aids prepared by the creator (e.g., registers, indexes, etc.) that are part of the unit being described.

# 5.1 Custodial History (Added Value)

## Purpose and Scope

This element provides information on changes of ownership or custody of the material being described, from the time it left the possession of the creator until it was acquired by the repository, that is significant for its authenticity, integrity, and interpretation.

Commentary: The archivist should determine when it is desirable to create an access point for a custodian. It is probably not necessary to do so for custodians who merely stored the materials.

## Exclusions

**5.1.1** Record information about the donor or source from which the archives directly acquired the unit being described in the Immediate Source of Acquisition Element (5.2).

## Sources of Information

**5.1.2** Derive the information from transfer documents such as donor agreements.

## General Rules

**5.1.3** Record the successive transfers of ownership, responsibility, or custody or control of the unit being described from the time it left the possession of the creator until its acquisition by the repository, along with the dates thereof, insofar as this information can be ascertained and is significant to the user's understanding of the authenticity.

<p class="dacs-example">Franklin Delano Roosevelt's gubernatorial records were initially deposited at the Roosevelt Presidential Library following his death. In 1982 they were returned by the Roosevelt Library to the New York State Archives.</p>

<p class="dacs-example">Many of the records in this series were created or compiled by the U.S. Army before the Japanese invasion of the Philippines. Just before the surrender of U.S. forces, the records were buried to prevent capture and were retrieved after the U.S. forces reoccupied the Philippines in 1945.</p>
# 5.2 Immediate Source of Acquisition (Added Value)

## Purpose and Scope

This element identifies the source from which the repository directly acquired the materials being described, as well as the date of acquisition, the method of acquisition, and other relevant information.

Commentary: The immediate source of acquisition is the person or organization from which the materials being described were acquired through donation, purchase, or transfer. Because some information relating to acquisitions may be considered confidential, each institution must establish a consistent policy to determine the information to be included in publicly available descriptive records.

## Exclusions

**5.2.1** Record information about changes of ownership or custody of the materials being described that do not involve direct acquisition by the repository and that are significant for its authenticity, integrity, and interpretation in the Custodial History Element (5.1).

## Sources of information

**5.2.2** Take the information from transfer documents such as deeds of gift.

## General Rules

**5.2.3** Record the source(s) from which the materials being described were acquired, the date(s) of acquisition, and the method of acquisition, if this information if not confidential.

<p class="dacs-example">Received from Charles Edward Eaton, Chapel Hill, N.C., in a number of installments beginning in 1977.</p>
<p class="dacs-example">Gifts, 1962-1963.</p>

**5.2.4** Optionally, record the source/donor's relationship to the materials, and any other information considered relevant (e.g., address of the source/donor, agent, price, source of funding), if this information is not confidential.

<p class="dacs-example">The Yale University Library acquired the Whitney Papers through gifts in 1941 and 1953 from Eli Whitney's great-granddaughters, Susan Brewster Whitney, Elizabeth Fay Whitney, Henrietta Edwards Whitney Sanford, Anne Farnam Whitney Debevoise, and Frances Pierrepont Whitney Knight.</p>

### Identifying Numbers

**5.2.5** Optionally, record identifying number(s) of the acquisitions, such as an accession number or reference code.

<p class="dacs-example">This collection was donated by the Michigan Organization for Human Rights in May 1983; material was added in February and September 1994. The Robert Lundy files were added in 1998. Donor no. 6933.</p>
<p class="dacs-example">Gift and purchase, 1996 (G10669, R13821).</p>
# 5.3 Appraisal, Destruction, and Scheduling Information (Added Value)

## Purpose and Scope

This element provides information about the rationale for appraisal decisions, destruction actions, and disposition schedules that are relevant to the understanding and use of the materials being described.

Commentary: Not all materials offered to, or acquired by, a repository merit permanent retention. The process of determining the archival value of records (and thus the attendant disposition of unwanted records) is known as appraisal. A number of considerations go into appraisal decisions, including the current administrative, legal, and fiscal use of the records; their evidential, intrinsic, and informational value; their arrangement and condition; and their relationship to other records. In many cases, material is not selected for permanent retention or only a sample is retained. In other cases, material not normally selected may be retained for particular reasons. Documenting appraisal decisions and the rationale for retention or destruction of selected archival materials provides significant information relevant to the interpretation of the materials being described.

Organizations with a records management program transfer materials to archives in accordance with records schedules. A records schedule is a document that describes the records of an organization, establishes the length of time the records are required to carry out the organization's business, and provides authorization for their disposition. Disposition can include destruction or retention in a repository. Thus, appraisal decisions and the justification for them are an inherent part of records schedules. Archives that receive regular transfers of records from their parent bodies may wish to include in their descriptions (or by means of links to the records management system) the rationale for the appraisal decisions documented in records schedules.

## Exclusions

**5.3.1** Record information about expected accruals in the Accruals Element (5.4).

**5.3.2** Record information about gaps in the unit being described due to reasons other than appraisal/destruction actions in the Scope and Content Element (3.1).

## Sources of Information

**5.3.3** Take the information from repository documentation, such as retention schedules.

### General Rules

**5.3.4** Where the destruction or retention of archival materials has a bearing on the interpretation and use of the unit being described, provide information about the materials destroyed or retained and provide the reason(s) for the appraisal decision(s), where known.

<p class="dacs-example">Appraisal criteria for file retention included the presence of attorney's handwritten notes, substantiating correspondence, depositions, and transcripts, which are seldom or never present in the Supreme Court's files.</p>

-------------------------

<p class="dacs-example">The State Archives will retain all pre-1920 patient case files in their entirety. The State Archives will retain a representative sample of post-1920 patient case files from the following facilities: Binghamton, Pilgrim,... The sample captures specific patient populations and treatments as defined in the detailed appraisal report, as well as providing geographic coverage. The sample is necessary because more than 110,000 cubic feet of patient case files currently exist and cannot be microfilmed or retained in paper form. Admission and discharge ledgers for all patients will be retained by the State Archives to ensure that core information survives on all patients for all facilities.</p>

------------------------

<p class="dacs-example">After they were microfilmed, the original letterpress copies were destroyed due to their illegibility.</p>

**5.3.5** Where appropriate, record the authority for the action.

<p class="dacs-example">All files in this series are appraised as "retain permanently" under disposal authorities RDS440/10.1, RDA458/8.1, and RDA1176/8.1.</p>

**5.3.6** Optionally, record the date(s) of the appraisal/destruction action(s).

<p class="dacs-example">Originals were destroyed by the National Archives in 1982 in accordance with the Department's approved Appraisal and Disposition Schedule.</p>
<p class="dacs-example">Originals destroyed after microfilming, 1981.</p>
# 5.4 Accruals (Added Value)

## Purpose and Scope

This element informs the user of anticipated additions to the unit being described. An accrual is an acquisition of archival materials additional to that already in the custody of the repository.

## Sources of Information

**5.4.1** Take the information from donor agreements, records schedules, and institutional policy.

## General Rules

**5.4.2** If known, indicate whether or not further accruals are expected. When appropriate, indicate frequency and volume.

<p class="dacs-example">Further accruals are expected.</p>
<p class="dacs-example">No further accruals are expected.</p>
<p class="dacs-example">The repository continues to add materials to this collection on a regular basis.</p>
<p class="dacs-example">Records from the Office of the Protocol and Ceremonials are transferred to the archives five years following the academic year to which the records relate. On average, 1 linear foot of records is transferred to the archives annually on August 1.</p>
<p class="dacs-example">Since 1964, approximately fifty maps have been transferred to the archives on an annual basis.</p>
<p class="dacs-example">Files older than ten years are transferred in accordance with the records retention schedule for the Department of Housing.</p>

### Processing Information

**7.1.8** Provide information about actions of the archivist, custodians, or creators of the records or conventions in the finding aid that may have an impact on a researcher's interpretation of the records or understanding of the information provided in the finding aid.

<p class="dacs-example">Actions and conventions include but are not limited to reconstruction of provenance, maintenance, reconstruction, or alteration of original order, devising titles for materials, weeding, and maintenance or provision of control numbers or container numbers.</p>

#### **Exclusions**

Some actions noted according to this rule may reference arrangement; however, for identification of the current system of arrangement, see Element 3.2.

#### **Examples**

<p class="dacs-example">The records of the League of Women Voters received by the Library between 1933 and 1968 were described in a preliminary finding aid that was updated in 1994 with the addition of material received between 1979 and 1990.</p>

<p class="dacs-example"><em>Processing information for the</em> League of Women Voters (U.S.) records, Library of Congress</p>

<p class="dacs-example">Upon arrival in the Library of Congress, the Gifford Pinchot Papers were placed in manuscript containers, with a descriptive container listing providing the only access to the collection. Substantial portions of the papers were reorganized in 1973 into a more coherent arrangement, and new series were created to bring similar material together.</p>

<p class="dacs-example">In 1989 the Library of Congress, in conjunction with the United States Forest Service, undertook a cooperative project to organize and describe those portions of the Pinchot Papers that concerned the early period of the conservation movement and the first five years of the Forest Service from 1890 to 1910. Selected records and files were rearranged to document Pinchot's contribution to the founding of the conservation movement. Due to the interfiling, transposition, and removal of material that resulted from this reorganization, gaps occurred in the former sequence of arrangement of the manuscript containers. These gaps are identified in the container list by the statement "removed from collection." Final processing of this segment of the Pinchot Papers was completed in 1991.</p>

<p class="dacs-example">In addition to the rearrangement of a portion of the collection between 1989 and 1991, new material was appended in 1985 and 1998. Other revisions were made in 2007, and the finding aid was revised again in 2011.</p>

Alteration or maintenance of arrangement examples:

<p class="dacs-example">Unless otherwise noted in the series and subseries descriptions, the arrangement scheme for the collection was imposed during processing in the absence of a usable original order.</p>

<p class="dacs-example"><em>Processing information for the</em> Frederick Reines papers</p>

<p class="dacs-example">The original arrangement and folder titles were retained in most cases. Exceptions include legal-sized material, which was re-housed into appropriate containers.</p>

<p class="dacs-example"><em>Processing information for the</em> Papers of George Wald, Harvard University Archives</p>

<p class="dacs-example">The original chronological arrangement of the series was maintained during processing. The sole exception to this arrangement is several files of correspondence with physicists that Reines maintained separately from the chronological files, which are arranged alphabetically by the physicists' surnames at the end of the series.</p>

<p class="dacs-example"><em>Processing information for the</em> Frederick Reines papers</p>

<p class="dacs-example">This collection was previously listed in the Harvard University Archives shelflist among the records of the Harvard College Library but otherwise uncataloged. It was processed in 2010. Processing involved a collection survey and arrangement into series and subseries, re-housing in appropriate archival folders and boxes, and the creation of this finding aid.</p>

<p class="dacs-example">These papers of Betty Friedan were previously designated by an accession number range: "71-62--81-M23." ... The papers arrived in no order; most documents were not in folders. They were roughly sorted and screened so they could be made available for research use. Folder titles were created by the archivist. In 2009, the archivist reboxed the collection, added more description to folder titles and scope and content notes, and intellectually rearranged some folders; the physical arrangement was retained. Basic folder numbers remain the same as in "71-62--81-M23," but for preservation purposes, many overly full folders have been divided, adding alphabetical designations to the previously assigned numbers (e.g., #149a-149b).</p>

# Introduction to Archival Authority Records

The structure and content of archival materials cannot be completely understood without some knowledge of the context in which they were created. It is insufficient for the archivist simply to include the name of the creator in the title of the description of the materials. Additional information is required regarding the corporate bodies, persons, and families responsible for the creation, assembly, accumulation, and/or maintenance and use of the archival materials being described. Part II describes the information that is required to establish this context. It is the logical outcome of Principle 4 in the Statement of Principles: that the creators of archival materials, as well as the materials themselves, must be described.

**Definition of Terms**

*   Corporate body: an organization or group of people identified by a name and that acts, or may act, as a unit, or an institutional position held by a person

*   Person: an individual of the human species

*   Family: two or more people related through marriage, birth, adoption, or other legal manner, or who present themselves as a family

These definitions disallow the creation of headings for personas, bibliographic identities, and animals but otherwise would not create significant divergence from library authority file structures.

There are three steps in the process of creating the documentation that establishes archival context.

*   The archivist must first identify the corporate bodies, individuals, and families that played a significant role in the creation of the materials.

Element 2.6, Name of Creator(s), provides specific guidance as to which of these entities need to be associated with the description of the materials, based on their role in the creation, assembly, accumulation, and/or maintenance and use of the records.

*   The archivist must assemble biographical information about these individuals and families or data about the history, structure, functions, and relationships of the relevant organization.

Element 2.7, Administrative/Biographical History, provides guidance on recording biographical data or administrative histories.

*   Finally, the names of these entities must be rendered in a standardized form using standardized vocabularies (e.g., _Library of Congress Authorities_) or with rules for formulating standardized names such as those found in AACR2, ISAAR(CPF), or RDA to facilitate the retrieval of information across descriptions, systems, and institutions.

Once formulated, this information may be presented to the user in either of two ways. Traditionally, archivists have incorporated the names of creators and contextual information about them directly into archival descriptions, both in catalog records and in finding aids. Such information, created according to DACS rules, may certainly continue to be employed in this manner.

However, DACS also provides an alternative: information about creators of archival materials can be captured and maintained in a separate system of archival authority records that are linked to the archival descriptions rather than being embedded within them. This approach reflects the model created by the International Council on Archives where the General International Standard for Archival Description (ISAD[G]) provides rules on description and the International Standard Archival Authority Record for Corporate Bodies, Persons and Families (ISAAR[CPF]) governs the creation of information about creators. Chapters 9 through 14 provide guidance on the construction of archival authority records based on the structure of ISAAR(CPF).

Separating the capture and maintenance of contextual information has a number of advantages. The ability to link a description of a creating entity to several descriptions of records from the same creator held within the same repository eliminates the need to duplicate the administrative/biographical history in each description. Furthermore, the practice enables the linking of descriptions of creating entities to descriptions of records from the same creator(s) held by more than one repository, as well as to descriptions of related library and museum materials, websites, and so on. Relationships between creating entities also can be documented in authority records. Finally, certain functions can be efficiently performed in authority records, such as maintaining a record of variant and related terms, which cannot be done well (or at all) within descriptions.

Where several repositories hold records of the same provenance, they can share or exchange contextual information about the creator more easily if it has been maintained in a standardized manner. Archival authority records do not merely _record_ contextual information, they also provide a means of _standardizing_ access points and the contextual information. They are similar to library authority records in that both support the creation of standardized access points in descriptions. Such standardization has two aspects: consistency and uniqueness. _Consistency_ requires that the name of a creator be identical each time it is used as an access point in the descriptive system. This is achieved by implementing rules that establish an authorized form of the name where different forms exist. _Uniqueness_ requires that each person, family, or corporate body have a heading that applies to it alone. This is achieved by making additions to otherwise identical names in order to distinguish between them. Whenever possible, repositories should use the form of personal and corporate names found in the _Library of Congress Authorities_ (formerly _Library of Congress Name Authority File_ [LCNAF]) or use rules for formulating standardized names such as those found in AACR2, ISAAR(CPF), or RDA.

While archival authority records and the bibliographic authority records used in library systems are similar, they differ in significant ways. A bibliographic authority record consists of an authorized heading that standardizes the form of the name, as well as other information elements that describe the named entity or point to other authority records. Archival authority records contain the following elements similar to bibliographic authority records:

*   The authority entry (i.e., a standardized access point established by an archival agency uniquely identifying the corporate body, person, or family associated with the creation of the archival materials)
*   References to related names and variant names
*   Documentation of how the authority record was established and maintained

Beyond this, archival authority records support a much wider set of requirements than library authority records. These additional requirements derive from the importance of documenting the context of records creation in archival description and control systems. As such, archival authority records usually contain much more information than library authority records.

While archival authority records generally are distinguished from library authority records in that they focus on identifying and providing information about those associated in some way with the creation of archival materials, they do not include topical subjects, forms or genres, functions, or uniform titles. Archivists may also maintain authority files to control the terms used to provide access in these ways; however, such applications are beyond the scope of this standard.<sup>1</sup>

The two methods of presenting archival context information, i.e., within the description or in a separate authority file, are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, archives may quite reasonably maintain separate files of authority data for internal control purposes even when the names reflected in those records are embedded in descriptions. Archivists may also wish to describe some contextual information only in the Administrative/Biographical History Element (see Element 2.7) embedded in descriptions of archival materials.

## Purpose and Scope

Part II provides rules on the creation of authority records based on the data elements found in ISAAR(CPF).

## Exclusions

Instructions for describing the archival materials themselves are found in Part I.

Instructions for identifying creators are found in Part I, Element 2.6, and instructions for creating contextual information embedded in descriptions of archival materials are found in Part I, Element 2.7.

Instructions for formatting names of persons, families, or corporate bodies identified as creators using the rules in Element 2.6 are found in companion standards.

## Structure and Numbering

Part II consists of six chapters. Chapter 9 provides general rules for creating authority records for repositories that wish to maintain separate authority systems. Chapters 10 through 14 provide rules for the different areas of archival authority records.

## Descriptive Outputs

The rules provide for data input but do not prescribe particular outputs or display. Presentation of this information to the user, including the way that the authority information is linked to the descriptions of the materials, will be determined by institutional policy within each repository's descriptive system.

## Examples

The examples in Part II are illustrative, not prescriptive. They illustrate only the application of the rule to which they are appended. Furthermore, the presentation of the examples is intended only to assist in understanding how to use the rules and does not imply a prescribed layout, typography, or output.

* * *

[1] DACS does not provide rules for the construction and maintenance of subject authorities. However, a corporate body, person, or family can also be the subject of a unit of description, and an archival authority record that conforms to DACS may also serve to control the form of name and identity of a corporate body, person, or family named in a subject access point. See Appendix B, Companion Standards.



### Chapter 9 

# Archival Authority Records

## Purpose and Scope

The purpose of Chapters 9 through 13 is to describe the elements of a fully documented archival authority record. Because of the variety of ways in which this data might be stored and used, DACS prescribes the required elements of information and describes how that content should be recorded. It does not prescribe the precise formats in which these elements are stored or presented to users.

Chapter 14 describes the ways in which authority records may be linked to other resources such as descriptions of archival materials, to other data about the entity such as biographical directories, or to contextual information in other countries and/or in other languages.

## Definition

An archival authority record identifies and describes a personal, family, or corporate entity associated with a body of archival materials; documents relationships between records creators, the records created by them, and/or other resources about them; and may control the creation and use of access points in archival descriptions. The International Standard Archival Authority Record for Corporate Bodies, Persons and Families (ISAAR[CPF]) organizes the types of information found in an archival authority record into four areas:

*   Identity Area: the authoritative form of the name of the entity as established by cataloging rules such as those found in AACR2or RDA, along with references to any variant forms of that name by which researchers might know that entity

*   Description Area: a description of the history and activities of the entity that are pertinent to the records with which it is associated, written in accordance with the rules in Chapter 11

*   Relationships Area: references to related persons, families, and corporate bodies

*   Control Area: management information regarding the creation and status of the record

Although archival authority records are similar to library authority records in that they both support the creation of standardized access points in descriptions, archival authority records support a much wider set of requirements than library authority records do and usually contain detailed information about records creators and the context of record creation.

## Statement of Principles

Descriptions in authority files may be recorded electronically as part of an information system linked to descriptions of archival materials, in a paper-based system of finding aids in the manner of traditional _see_ and _see also_ references in a card catalog, or as a "shelf list" or official file strictly for internal staff control of the information.

Authority information may be used in a variety of ways. It can provide access to archival materials based on descriptions of records creators or the context of records creation that are linked to descriptions of physically dispersed records. It can provide users an understanding of the context underlying the creation and use of archival materials so they can better interpret their meaning and significance. It can help users identify records creators by providing descriptions of relationships between different entities, particularly in cases of administrative changes within corporate bodies or personal changes in families and individuals. Finally, standardized authority information allows for the exchange of descriptions of individuals, families, and corporate bodies between institutions, systems, and networks and across national and linguistic boundaries.

While these rules address the formation of descriptions for persons, families, and corporate bodies associated with the creation and custody of archival materials (frequently referred to in the rules as _entities_), authority records may also be created to document entities that are the subject of materials in such records. The same type of data is appropriate in either situation.

## Levels of Description

DACS defines a number of elements that are useful in creating systems for describing creators of archival material. Regardless of the system, the output products must include at a minimum a set of discrete descriptive elements that convey standardized information about the creators being described. These DACS elements match the required elements found in the International Standard Archival Authority Record for Corporate Bodies, Persons and Families(ISAAR[CPF])_._

Not all of the DACS elements are required in every archival authority record. Combinations of descriptive elements will vary depending on whether the archivist considers a specific authority record to be preliminary or complete and repository-specific needs and requirements for describing creators.

The following requirements specify particular elements that should be used in output products intended for the use of archivists or researchers in managing and using descriptions of archival creators. They articulate a "minimum" and "added value" usage of the elements defined by DACS but are not intended to preclude use of other descriptive data that a repository deems necessary for its own descriptive systems or products. DACS does not specify the order or arrangement of elements in a particular descriptive output. Some systems or output formats, such as MARC 21, RDA or EAC-CPF, provide specific guidance on the ordering of some or all elements. Others, such as a repository's preliminary accession record or a print finding aid, should include DACS elements in a logical and consistent manner determined by the repository's own procedures and standard practices.

### Minimum

An authority record with the minimum number of DACS elements includes:

*   Authorized form of name (see 10.1)
*   Type of entity (see 10.2)
*   Dates of existence (see 11.1)
*   Authority record identifier (see 13.2)

### Added Value

An authority record using DACS elements to provide added value for researchers has all of the elements included in Minimum above, plus any other elements the repository wishes to include.

## Exclusions

**9.1** Record information about the relationships between descriptions of archival materials in the Related Materials Element (6.3).

**9.2** Record information about the relationships between levels of arrangement within a description in the System of Arrangement Element (3.2).

## Sources of Information

**9.3** Take the information from any reliable source.

## General Rule

**9.4** Create an authority record for each person, family, or corporate body associated with the creation of archival materials as specified in the rule

<p class="dacs-example">Hubert H. Humphrey was born in Wallace, South Dakota, on May 27, 1911. He left South Dakota to attend the University of Minnesota but returned to South Dakota to help manage his father's drug store early in the Depression. He attended the Capitol College of Pharmacy in Denver, Colorado, and became a register pharmacist in 1933. On September 3, 1936, Humphrey married Muriel Fay Buck. He returned to the University of Minnesota and earned a B.A. degree in 1939. In 1940 he earned an M.A. in political science from Louisiana State University and returned to Minneapolis to teach and pursue further graduate study, but he began working for the W.P.A. (Works Progress Administration). He moved on from there to a series of positions with wartime agencies. In 1943, he ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Minneapolis and returned to teaching as a visiting professor at Macalester College in St. Paul. Between 1943 and 1945, Humphrey worked at a variety of jobs. In 1945, he was elected mayor of Minneapolis and served until 1948. In 1948, at the Democratic National Convention, he gained national attention when he delivered a stirring speech in favor of a strong civil rights plank in the party's platform. In November 1948, Humphrey was elected to the United States Senate. He served as the Senate Democratic Whip from 1961 to 1964.</p>

<p class="dacs-example">In 1964, at the Democratic National Convention, President Lyndon B. Johnson asked the convention to select Humphrey as the vice presidential nominee. The ticket was elected in November in a Democratic landslide. In 1968, Humphrey was the Democratic Party's candidate for president, but he was defeated narrowly by Richard M. Nixon. After the defeat, Humphrey returned to Minnesota to teach at the University of Minnesota and Macalester College. He returned to the U.S. Senate in 1971, and he won reelection in 1976. He died on January 13, 1978, of cancer.</p>

Record the name(s) of any higher body(ies) having authority or control over the corporate body, or any corporate body(ies) over which it exercised authority or control, and describe the nature and any change of the authority or controlling relationship.

<p class="dacs-example">Until 1586, the internal structure of the Council of War was minimal. With the king as president, the Council was constituted of various councilors and a secretary, who was in turn on other councils, assisted by officers, clerks, and other subordinate staff. Beginning in 1554, an auditor was responsible for judicial matters, expanding the number of councilors, which ranged between five and ten. In 1586 the position of secretary of the Council of War was split into the Secretariat of Land and the Secretariat of Sea. The greater control of two areas of conflict caused the division of the Secretariat of Land in 1646 into two: the Secretariat of Land, Cataluña and the Secretariat of Land-Extremadura. After the coming of the Bourbon dynasty in the early eighteenth century, the secretariats underwent successive administrative reorganizations according to their new roles and were eventually merged in 1706. In 1717 the structure of the Council was reduced in term of the number of councilors, divided into military and judicial, the presidency fell to the Secretary of the War Office, and the secretary disappeared, with administrative activity processed by the clerk of the House. In 1773 this structure was again revised, with the presidency returning to its traditional association with the king and the number of councilors expanded to twenty, including ten ex officio and ten assistants divided between government and justice and again establishing the role of secretary. The staff also included two prosecutors, three reporters, a house clerk, lawyer, tax agent, solicitor, officers, clerks, bailiffs, and doormen. This structure remained practically stable until the abolition of the Council of War in 1834.</p>

**11.7.3** For families, describe family relationships so as to document the relationships between family members.

<p class="dacs-example">Sir Edward Noel (died 1643) married Julian, daughter and co-heir of Baptists Hicks (died 1629), Viscount Campden, and succeeded to the viscounty of Campden and a portion of his father-in-law's estates. The third Viscount Campden (1612-1682) married Hester Wotton, daughter of the second Baron Wotton. The fourth Viscount Campden (1641-1689, created Earl of Gainsborough 1682) married Elizabeth Wriothesley, elder daughter of the fourth Earl of Southampton. Jane Noel (died 1811), sister of the fifth and sixth Earls of Gainsborough, married Gerard Anne Edwards of Welham Grove (Leicestershire) and had issue Gerard Noel Edwards (1759-1838). He married in 1780 Diana Middleton (1762-1823) suo jure Baroness Barham, daughter of Charles Middleton (1726-1813), created first Baronet of Barham Court (Kent) in 1781 and first Baron Barham in 1805. GN Edwards assumed the surname Noel in 1798 on inheriting the sixth Earl of Gainsborough's Rutland and Gloucestershire estates (though not the earl's honours, which were extinguished); and he later inherited his father-in-law's baronetcy. His eldest son John Noel (1781-1866) succeeded to the estates of his mother and his father, to his mother's barony and his father's baronetcy, and was created Viscount Campden and Earl of Gainsborough in 1841.</p>

<p class="dacs-example"><strong>Historical Summary (11.2.1):</strong></p>

<p class="dacs-example">Thomas Cadell was born in Bristol on 12 November 1742 but spent most of his life in London. When Cadell was fifteen, his father sent him to be an apprentice to Andrew Millar (1707-1768), a well-regarded publisher and bookseller who had supported the publication of Samuel Johnson's <em>Dictionary</em>. After seven years, Cadell became a partner in the business and finally took it over when Millar retired in 1767. His clients and friends were among the most influential literary and intellectual figures of the eighteenth century and included Fanny Burney (1752-1840), Robert Burns (1759-1796), David Hume (1711-1776), Samuel Johnson (1709-1784), Hannah More (1745-1833), Adam Smith (1723-1790), and Tobias Smollett (1721-1771). When Cadell retired in 1793, he gave his business to his son, Thomas Cadell (1773-1836) and his former assistant, William Davies (d. 1820). Before his death from an asthma attack in 1802, he enjoyed an active retirement, fulfilling many charitable and public positions, including governor of the Foundling Hospital and sheriff in the Walbrook ward of London.</p>

# 12.1 Names/Identifiers of Related Corporate Bodies, Persons, or Families

Commentary: In describing the parties that created, assembled, accumulated, and/or maintained and used archival records, it will be useful to identify related persons, families, and organizations. They may be connected in a variety of ways, such as members of families, hierarchical relationships between parts of organizations, chronological (i.e., predecessor/successor) relationships between organizations or parts of organizations, or offices held by a person within an organization. Related names might also be used within a descriptive system as alternative access points to descriptions of archival records or as links to other authority records.

**12.1.1** Record the authorized names and any relevant unique identifiers, including the authority record identifier, of corporate bodies, persons, or families that have a significant relationship with the entity named in the authority record.

<p class="dacs-example">MnHi (<em>Repository code for the Minnesota Historical Society assigned by the Library of Congress in the</em> MARC Code List for Organizations)</p>
<p class="dacs-example">OCLC-MHS (<em>International Standard Identifier for Libraries [ISIL] identifier for Minnesota Historical Society</em></p>
* * *

[1] The Library of Congress is responsible for assigning repository codes and maintaining the list of assigned codes in the United States. National repository codes are constructed using the latest version of ISO 15511 (International Standard identifier for libraries and related organizations). Repositories may also wish to include an International Standard Identifier for Libraries or ISIL code. ISILs are a unique identifier issued by the ISIL Agency to create an identifier to enable unique identification of a library or related institution. An ISIL is made up by two components: a prefix and a library identifier, in that order, separated by a mandatory hyphen. An OCLC symbol can be rendered as ISIL by the addition of the prefix "OCLC" or "O" for technical encoding in cases such as RFID tags.



# 13.2 Authority Record Identifier (Required)

**13.2.1** Record a unique identifier for the authority record. The number may be assigned locally or be based upon an identifier from a regional or national database such as the _Library of Congress Authorities_.

<p class="dacs-example">ARC-ID-976172 (<em>unique identifier assigned by the National Archives and Records Administration to an archival authority record</em>)</p>  

<p class="dacs-example">02-79026910 (<em>unique identifier based upon the Library of Congress Control Number [79026910]</em>)</p>

<p class="dacs-example">beinecke.j0zpcks (<em>locally assigned identifier</em>)</p>
# 13.3 Rules or Conventions

**13.3.1** Record by text or codes the international, national, or local rules or conventions followed in creating the authority record. Establish an institutional policy on how to cite published standards, that is, detail provided, use of abbreviations, and so on.

<p class="dacs-example">Describing Archives: A Content Standard (DACS)</p>

<p class="dacs-example">Resource Description and Access (RDA)</p>

**13.3.2** Specify separately which rules have been applied for creating the authorized form of name.

<p class="dacs-example">U.S. National Archives and Records Administration, Lifecycle Data Requirements Guide <em>(for creating the authorized form of the name)</em></p>

<p class="dacs-example">Authorized form of name created according to AACR2 rules</p>

**13.3.3** Include reference to any system(s) of dating used to identify dates in the authority record.

<p class="dacs-example">ISO 8601-Data Elements and Interchange Formats-Information Interchange-Representation of Dates and Times. 2nd ed. Geneva: International Standards Organization, 2000.</p>
# 13.4 Status

**13.4.1** Record the current status of the authority record, indicating whether the record is a draft, finalized and/or revised or deleted. Using codes or text, record the status in the form prescribed in companion standards or in appropriate controlled vocabularies.

<p class="dacs-example">&lt;maintenanceStatus&gt;deletedReplaced&lt;/maintenanceStatus&gt;</p>

<p class="dacs-example"><em>EAC-CPF encoding indicating that the record has been deleted and replaced</em></p>

<p class="dacs-example">00731cz</p>

<p class="dacs-example">(<em>The character</em> c <em>in the fifth position of the leader of this MARC authority record indicates that it is a "corrected" record.</em>)</p>

**13.4.2** Alternately, record the current status of the record using the following terms: draft, finalized, revised, or obsolete.

<p class="dacs-example">Authority record is obsolete.</p>
# 13.5 Level of Detail

**13.5.1** Indicate whether the record contains minimal, partial, or full information. This data may be recorded as text or codes.

<p class="dacs-example">006521nz_2200067n</p>

<p class="dacs-example"><em>(The character</em> n <em>in the seventeenth position of the leader of this MARC authority record indicates that it meets "national level record requirements.")</em></p>

# 14.1 Identifiers and Titles of Related Resources

Commentary: While authority records are created to document the context in which archival materials were created, it is also desirable to associate them with descriptions of the materials themselves and with other, external data that provides additional information about the entity described in the record. These connections may be electronic links within an archival information system between the authority record and associated descriptions or links to external files such as online biographical databases. They may also be recorded as citations in a print-based authority file.

**14.1.1** Provide the unique identifiers/reference codes or titles for the related resources necessary to establish a connection between the entity and the related resource.

<p class="dacs-example">Humphrey, Hubert H. (Hubert Horatio), 1911-1978 (<em>entity described in archival authority record</em>)</p>

# 14.3 Nature of Relationship to Related Resources

**14.3.1** Describe the nature of the relationships between the corporate body, person, or family and the related resource, for example, creator, author, subject, custodian, copyright owner, controller, owner. Where possible, terms should be applied from a controlled vocabulary (e.g., _Resource Description and Access_, Appendix I, or the _MARC Code List for Relators_).

His clients and friends were among the most influential literary and intellectual figures of the eighteenth century and included Fanny Burney (1752-1840), Robert Burns (1759-1796), David Hume (1711-1776), Samuel Johnson (1709-1784), Hannah More (1745-1833), Adam Smith (1723-1790), and Tobias Smollett (1721-1771). When Cadell retired in 1793, he gave his business to his son, Thomas Cadell (1773-1836) and his former assistant, William Davies (d. 1820). Before his death from an asthma attack in 1802, he enjoyed an active retirement, fulfilling many charitable and public positions, including governor of the Foundling Hospital and sheriff in the Walbrook ward of London.

# Appendices

# Appendix A 2004 Preface

_Archives, Personal Papers, and Manuscripts_<sup>1</sup> has served the U.S. archival community as a content standard for catalog records for more than two decades. The advent of new technologies and descriptive tools, including the Web, XML, and EAD, have encouraged archivists to go beyond placing basic catalog records in online systems to putting full descriptions of their holdings, frequently enhanced with digital images, on the Web. Archival descriptions in an online environment, where not only researchers but other archivists can see them, have highlighted differences and similarities in practice between repositories and brought to the fore the need for a content standard for finding aids.

As a descriptive standard of the Society of American Archivists, _APPM_ was placed on a review/revision schedule in the early 1990s. By the time EAD was launched in 1996, it was apparent that any revision of _APPM_ should incorporate rules for finding aids as well as for catalog records. It was also thought that the two international standards, the _General International Standard Archival Description_ (_ISAD(G)_)<sup>2</sup> and the _International Standard Archival Authority Record for Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families_ (_ISAAR (CPF)_),<sup>3</sup> should be accommodated, and that perhaps a joint Canadian/U.S. standard could be created.

To that end, discussions with descriptive standards experts in Canada began with a week-long Bentley Library Research Fellowship Program project in summer 1996. The results of that project were promising enough that the discussions continued and, in 1999, the Gladys Kreibel Delmas Foundation funded another joint meeting in Toronto, which produced the “Toronto Accord on Descriptive Standards.” It seemed that there was enough common ground to pursue a joint project.

## The CUSTARD Project

In 2001 the Society of American Archivists received a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, which was augmented by the Delmas Foundation, to embark on a joint U.S.-Canadian descriptive standard project called CUSTARD (Canadian-U.S. Task Force on Archival Description). The project as envisioned would produce a content standard that would replace _APPM_ and possibly the Canadian _Rules for Archival Description_ (_RAD_),<sup>4</sup> accommodate all the data elements of _ISAD(G)_ and _ISAAR(CPF)_, and be applicable to all types of archival descriptions. To do this, eight Canadian archivists, seven U.S. archivists, and the project manager<sup>5</sup> met four times over two years to draft a set of rules.

By spring 2003 it had become apparent that there were enough significant differences between Canadian and U.S. practice that a joint content standard was not possible at this time. Consequently, the Canadians are using the CUSTARD project draft as the basis for a new edition of _RAD_ (_RAD_2), and the U.S. archivists have distilled the draft into _Describing Archives: A Content Standard_ (_DACS_). Despite continued maintenance of two separate national standards, the dialogue between Canadian and U.S. archivists will surely continue.

## Relationship to Other Standards

_DACS_ is related to three other groups of standards. Descriptions created according to _DACS_ may be stored and exchanged electronically using the syntax of data structure and communication protocols like _MARC 21_ and _EAD_. Various thesauri and authority files may serve as the basis for indexing _DACS_ records as described in the Overview of Archival Description. Most significantly, _DACS_ is associated with other descriptive conventions, notably _APPM_, which it supersedes. That relationship is detailed in the following section. There are also close connections to the _Resource Description and Access (RDA)_ and with the two conventions promulgated by the International Council on Archives: _ISAD(G)_ and _ISAAR(CPF)_.

Like _APPM_, _DACS_ was developed in part as a replacement for the skeletal rules in Chapter 4 of _AACR2_, which itself acknowledges the need for other cataloging codes. Its Rule 0.1 states, “These rules are designed for use in the construction of catalogues and other lists in general libraries of all sizes. They are not specifically intended for specialist and archival libraries, but such libraries are recommended to use the rules as the basis of their cataloguing and to augment their provisions as necessary.” In this way, _DACS_ provides more specific guidance in the description of contemporary archival materials and eliminates some of the less user-friendly aspects of _AACR2_, including many abbreviations and the coded recording of uncertain dates, conventions necessitated by the space limitations of 3x5 catalog cards but no longer helpful or necessary in modern information systems. It also provides syntax for the recording of names when families have been identified as the creators of archival materials. While not included in _AACR2_, the use of family names as creators in the description of archives was part of previous bibliographic cataloging codes, has a long tradition in archival descriptive practice, and has been officially sanctioned at least since the first edition of _APPM_ was published by the Library of Congress in 1983.

All 26 data elements of _ISAD(G)_ and _ISAAR(CPF)_ are incorporated into _DACS_, in some cases virtually word for word. The exception is the exclusion, for two reasons, of the Level of Description element from _ISAD(G)_. While five levels of arrangement and description are recognized in _ISAD(G)_, experienced archivists understand that complex holdings often include many more levels of hierarchy. At this time, there is no consensus in the U.S. as to how existing terminology might be applied when there are more than five levels of arrangement. There is no benefit in prescribing data that cannot be applied consistently, especially when such uniformity is a primary requirement for the use of the information. Moreover, the simple recording of the level element, even if it could be assigned in a standardized way, is obviously insufficient for linking together information in the various parts of a multilevel description. As a more pragmatic solution, Chapter 1 of _DACS_ simply requires that an information system employ some means of linking together the various levels of description. This could involve linked _MARC_ records, nested components in _EAD_, associated tables in a relational database, or some other local solution.

## Comparison to _APPM_

Those accustomed to using _APPM_ will have little difficulty adopting this new standard. Everything that was in the second edition of _APPM_ is here, and more. While _APPM_ was a content standard intended specifically for the creation of catalog records, _DACS_ can be used to create any type or level of description of archival and manuscript materials, including catalog records and full finding aids. In addition, DACS moves away from the bibliographic model represented by the _Anglo-American Cataloging Rules_<sup>6</sup> and to a certain extent followed by _APPM_, to reflect a more thoroughly archival approach to description.

Structurally speaking, _APPM_ is divided into two parts and _DACS_ three: _APPM_ comprises Part I. Description, and Part II. Headings and Uniform Titles; _DACS_ comprises Part I. Describing Archival Materials, Part II. Describing Creators, and Part III. Forms of Names. The organization of the data elements is different in several instances. Many of the elements in the _APPM_ Note Area (1.7) are now rearranged into different conceptual areas or even separate chapters in _DACS_. For example, Biographical/Historical Note (_APPM_ 1.7B1) is now Chapter 10 Administrative/Biographical History in Part II of _DACS_. In this, as in many other cases, significantly more guidance as to the content of the data element is provided. In addition, the numbering system has been simplified in _DACS_. Within each data element, only the rules themselves are numbered. The exceptions to this are Chapters 12–14, which, as they are drawn from _AACR2_, follow that standard’s numbering system. Further, DACS simply omits areas mentioned in _APPM_ that have little or no relevance to the description of archival materials, such as bibliographic series, parallel titles, statements of responsibility, etc.

The Statement of Principles, a revision of the principles developed early in the CUSTARD project, provides a concise articulation of the nature of archival materials and how that nature translates into descriptive tools. The statement forms the underpinnings of the rules themselves.

## _DACS_

The Overview of Archival Description discusses various types of descriptive tools and the importance of providing access points or index terms to lead researchers to them. While names of creators and functions are powerful access mechanisms for the context of materials, the importance of topical subjects, documentary forms, geographic names, and other types of index terms are emphasized in this section.

Chapter 1 outlines the _DACS_ elements that must be included in different levels of descriptions, “level” referring both to the hierarchy of the materials themselves (i.e., whether a given description encompasses the entirety of an individual’s papers or a single letter therein) and to the amount of detail provided in the description. The chapter articulates specific data elements that should be included in descriptions ranging from accession records to full finding aids, from a collection-level MARC 21 record to a fully encoded EAD instance. “Requiredness” of specific data elements was cumbersome to articulate in the context of each rule due to varying needs and practices at different levels of description, so this information has been placed in text boxes on pages 8–11.

_DACS_ also contains a “commentary” for many data elements and occasionally for a specific rule. The commentaries serve to amplify, explain, or provide greater context for the element or rule, particularly in areas where archival practice has been less than uniform in the past.

_DACS_ integrates rules for describing archival and manuscript materials and collections. Gone is the notion of the “artificial” collection. Materials that are gathered together by a person, family, or organization irrespective of their provenance are intentionally and consciously assembled for some purpose. Most repositories in the U.S. have such collections, and they need to be handled and described the same way as materials traditionally considered to be “organic.”

_DACS_ contains no specific rules for the description of particular media, e.g., sound recordings, maps, photographs, etc. Standards for the description of such materials are created and maintained by other groups in the library and archival communities, and to reproduce these rules or try to supersede them here would be both presumptuous and a maintenance nightmare. Archivists who need such specialized rules should consult media-specific standards, which are listed in Appendix B.

Finally, while _DACS_ is designed to be output neutral, it nevertheless provides examples encoded in both EAD and MARC 21 for each data element in Part I, and for Chapters 9 and 10, as these are the two output systems currently used by most archivists.

# Appendix B Companion Standards

As indicated in the Overview, DACS includes basic rules for the types of holdings found in many archives, but they do not include all the rules needed to describe every possible type of document. Where further guidance is required, the following standards provide more detailed rules for describing published materials and particular types of nontextual materials. For the most comprehensive and up-to-date listing of standards, see the Society of American Archivists’ Standards Portal: http://www2.archivists.org/standards.
